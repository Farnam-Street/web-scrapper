			"My money quits and jumps off a cliff while I sleep",
			"I wish mine were that simple; they‚Äôre so theatrical. any accumulation of funds I‚Äôve desperately managed to gather for a day all clump together with me into my room when I go to sleep around 2am. it goes over to the corner near the foot of my bed where I  can see slight glimmers off several ligaments of its body as it glistens against the dim green smoke detector light.",
			"then it just stares at me, bro, like sm√©agol. just daring me to close my eyes. eventually I give up, and close my eyes to get it over with. I wait anxiously in the deafening silence, heartbeat elevated, praying that just today, maybe I get to keep my gains.",
			"then it happens, an unmistakably sharp, deep, jabbing noise as I hear the blade of a knife forcefully pierce the scaly nude epidermis of what was the reward of my day‚Äôs labors. what represented a spark of hope for my fading future to one day be able to escape this corrupt rat race struck to the heart.",
			"I open my eyes, and I can see shiny thin liquid dripping down on my hardwood floors emanating quickly from the unceremonious gash against the fruits of my labors. remnants of dried blood intermingled with carpet lint and residue lie stuck to the floor from my feeble attempts at cleaning up previous nights‚Äô congruous unfoldings.",
			"i hesitantly make eye contact with the bright open wet eyes staring hopelessly back at me, it‚Äôs dilapidated and fatally wounded body swaying, feebly trying to keep upright - until it inevitably collapses at the foot of my bed, an uncomfortable reminder of what fate awaits any possible gains in monetary purchasing power I may be able to scrounge up tomorrow.",

			"Fucker is down like a third of his portfolio lol",
			"Which one? Andrei?",
			"Oh, is his whole shtick just a meme then? Dividend investing is kinda moot?",
			"(I get the idea around here is overnight millionaires but I‚Äôm still genuinely asking)",
			"I mean he‚Äôs still up after the crash due to dividends even though many of his stocks are lower than when he bought them. So I wouldn‚Äôt call it moot, just not the kind of quick return the people here want.",
			"All of the dividend YouTubers are still \"up\" because they're pumping all their YouTube revenue into their m1 finance account and just comparing overall portfolio size from last year to this year",
			"It‚Äôs on Robinhood so I think it accounts for money added in but he‚Äôs still all time green.",
			"I do think it doesn‚Äôt account for stock transfers so if he‚Äôs done any of them that would throw it out of wack.",
			"I guess it depends on which YouTuber. I know one who doesn't ever show his actually portfolio, just percentages on a spreadsheet",
			"Oh lol, that is kind of sus.",
			"It's all fun and games until there's not sufficient cash flow and they cut the dividend. Then you get to hold junk for free.",
			"Got it. 100% in on REITs",
			"Sounds like dividend ETDs are the way then",
			"I think dividend investing is fine, but I don't think it's the smartest business move. If you were chasing high dividend payouts you'd be invested in REITs and would have just gotten slaughtered. Whether or not your goal is to get rich quick, it's gonna take some time for those to bounce back - if some of them ever do.",
			"Source: Am a dividend investor to a degree. REITs took heavy losses.",
			"So in a non-WSB manner, spreading my investments across stocks, options and dividends would be a good well balanced return? Hypothetically?",
			"I‚Äôm still getting into the market, and I hope to get into options eventually, but my goals are different than here. I do like checking in because there is plenty of insight, just a lot of bad timing and YOLO.",
			"I am also new to this, so I don't mess with Options. As for Stocks/Dividends, a Dividend is a cut of the profits paid to the shareholders. IE: You own a share of coke, you get one share of the profits when they pay a dividend.",
			"The benefit of a dividend is that you're always being cashed out just a little bit, which hedges your bet against loss and allows you to reinvest at a slowdrip pace into more shares or other stocks. It makes sense if you're planning on holding the stock for a long time. Blue chips like Coke, Pepsi, Union Pacific, are examples of good dividend paying stocks. They're known quantities and unlikely to see a whole lot of volatility and they have amazing track records for paying dividends.",
			"The downside of a dividend is that a company that pays out a dividend won't grow as fast because they have less money to reinvest into the business. But like in the examples I've given, they really don't have a ton of room for growth anyway.",
			"The reason I personally like stocks that pay dividends is because I get irrationally excited about passive income. So much so that I'm willing to forgo better gains because I like getting emails saying I made $6 the 20-30 times a year I get them. Most of the stocks I invest in are blue chip dividend payers anyway so my portfolio just makes mediocre gains and slowly grows from those dividend pay outs. Then I invest in REIT (think a mutual fund but they invest in Real Estate - Renting office buildings, mortgages, shit like that) and they legally have to pay a certain % dividend. As such they don't grow much, but the dividends are pretty high. They're also pretty volatile stocks and prone to getting hammered without much warning.",
			"I stopped reading at \"I dont mess with Options.\" Get the fuck outta here then. Ban.",
			"yeah, it was in one of his recent videos",
			"Yea and then sold off his shares at the bottom lmao",
			"Well if he switches to other stocks on the bottom it about equals out, also he can farm capital loss for tax write offs.",
			"I watched him for a bit. Now I purposefully avoid him because of his click baity titles.",
			"same more or less, soon as i see them, I just sort of auto distrust the content. Same with graham stephan. It all just seems less genuine and more like a sell out, even if some of their content is still good",
			"Works til it doesn't",
			"Unless he bought his shares 20 years ago. Then it's just sweet sweet cash flow.",
			"Some people call it cash flow, I call it taking out your investment. Every time you're paid a dividend that money's coming out of your investment. Paying dividends indicates the company can't make more money with that money.",
			"Lol I'm going to put my money in companies that know how to fucking allocate capital, paying out is pretty much an admission that they can't grow anymore which is a great time to get the fuck out.",
			"Maybe? It's like this. If you bought $500 shares of Walmart in 1980 or bought the same dollars worth in another non dividend company (say apple until 2013), the dividend alone outweighs the gains in share price. It's not a sexy play for sure but dividend gang does eat.",
			"Yea but they dont eat lobstah!",
			"this is wallstreetbets, no one is eating lobstah!",
			"His point is if Wal Mart had not paid those dividends and instead invested the cash into the business, the share price could be sky high. The Amazon model.",
			"Would it be close to say $8000 per share though?",
			"You'd still own your share of the undistributed cash, it really shouldn't make much difference.",
			"Also don't ignore the 3rd option, they can use excess profits to buy back instead of paying dividends, functionally identical but with different tax implications.",
			"Paying dividends indicates the company can't make more money with that money.",
			"Some companies make more money than they can effectively use to create growth.",
			"You could hope that Apple's $207 billion cash on hand directly translates to the stock price being $207 billion higher, or you could disburse it and deploy it to purchase $207 billion worth of stock in other companies each with their own potential to grow. Or into a larger percentage of the outstanding shares of Apple.",
			"No no no don't you see, the fact that Coca Cola can't invest all of its revenue into other avenues of profit means that it's not going to do well at all.  It's giving away money to shareholders, that's not an incentive to invest!",
			"Idk there's companies out there that can't make any more money with the money they have. Look at Google they are sitting on a skyscraper of liquid cash and can't spend money faster than they are making it. There are few companies out there that the dividends makes sense. Plus the reduced tax liability.",
			"Dividends also decrease volatility, therefore making prices less likely to decrease. I'm sure that has implications for taking out loans.",
			"Most companies start paying dividends once they've reached (near) peak market share for their industry",
			"I don't mind companies that know who they are and don't become the bloated monstrosity that GE, GM and some of the other legacy industrials have become. Like, chill GE you make electric parts, no you don't need to become a financial institution. We have seen the massive fail from that",
			"This man gripping to 200 shares of BRK-B just waiting for Buffett to croak so the next guy can announce dividends and he can cash out.",
			"Are you dumb? People buy brk so they can avoid taxes.",
			"What makes you think shareholders of Berkshire want dividends?? I'm not one of them but I'm pretty sure I would prefer being in control of what I'm taxed on. \nDividends aren't free money.",
			"For companies that are super profitable they kind of are.",
			"Uhhh, no. That‚Äôs not how asset pricing works.",
			"I think you‚Äôre thinking of dividends in the context of your situation. My dads retired and get purely dividend income to cover his expenses. He has not need for massive capital appreciation and life expectancy is only 20 more years based on actuarial tables.",
			"Absolutely. Every investor should shift toward income instead of growth. It's safer and will help them pay the bills.",
			"I mean, if the dividend is high enough it tends to outstrip the growth of most non-dividend stocks. Also that money doesn‚Äôt lose all its progress during a crash.",
			"Dividend paying stocks tend to outperform during recessions since most of those companies increase their yield; which means you'll have more cash available to buy other stocks that are currently way down.",
			"I'll be honest. I dont know anything about investing. But this comment has got to be some of the most retarded shit I've ever heard.",
			"So you think companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Visa have no more growth left?",
			"That is not always true...",
			"Most would call it a return on your investment.",
			"So you‚Äôre saying apple is a worthless investment?",
			"Yeah Coke and Disney are obviously doing really bad, no growth at all, Disney Plus? What‚Äôs that? The dividends prove they can‚Äôt grow bro.",
			"Yeah dude dogshit companies. If Amazon ever starts paying a dividend I will get physical shares issued and burn them.",
			"lmao this is the retardation I come here for",

			"U stupid fuck",
			"Don‚Äôt get to cocky",
			"My wife father has over 7 million invested in Apple , Microsoft and t Mobil",

			"Savings accounts are very jewish and I try to keep as little money in them as possible for mr goldberg to get his grimey nose in",

			"Yes, this guy right here IRS",
			"I got audited two years ago.  Most of the discrepancy had to do with the tax handling of my company's RSUs.  But they also bothered to list out all of my unreported savings interest for that year.",
			"Time to see how long I can play the tax-evasion game then because although my position is small (college kid) my dividends have been good to me. Keep pulling this off for 35 years or so and I may be able to buy some cocaine and hookers or something stupid",
			"Holy shit. If I limit my gains to $10 a year, I don't have to pay taxes!? :explodinghead:",
			"What happen if you just.. don‚Äôt?",
			"Not quite the same but I got a 1099-INT for the $.03 I made from my bank account",
			"Really? I think I made 10 cents last year and I didn't get anything",

			"There will be a point in the next 50-100 years where there is so much automation that a large percentage of the workforce will simply lack the skillsets or drive to work somewhere where they're useful (engineering those machines, programming AI, etc) and a UBI will be essential.",

			"Edit: a key thing here that a lot of people don't appreciate strongly enough is the potential for AI. A lot of people think \"Siri isn't going to be checking my water to make sure it's clean\"... But you're right. She's not. Siri is a narrow AI that Google's shit and ads things to your calendar. In 5 years the concept of a driverless car had evolved from a pipe dream to a reality in the consumer market. Just wait and see.",

			"You guys have been saying that for the last 50-100 years",
			"Sir I'm 24.",
			"But is UBI even necessary? Money goes much further than it used to on the basis of technological evolution alone. A sub $200 phone can access all of the world's knowledge. If you want, you can learn any skill free of charge. Learn a language. Get better at shit. DIY your entire home. Go on WSB and blow your savings. Your choice! Give this one device to someone 30 years ago and they would be floored. $200 for what would have been an infinite cost. Now, add automation to the equation. As the production of goods get cheaper due to scale of automation, the accessibility increases.",
			"People may be driven to what are more expensive goods due to affordability caused by technological evolution, but not out of necessity. Like saying you should get a 75\" 4K TV because others have one is not a reason for UBI.",

			"I mean yeah. Climate change is a big wall, and food shortages due to it will happen, it‚Äôs a question of when not if at this point. I just wished we could have reformed this system before it collapsed, because unless you get a group of educated world leaders any future civilizations will use oil to power themselves, because it‚Äôs the most efficient resource to rise to power quickly, and we will be 100% ratfucked.",
			"Climate change will lead to tons of new arable land in north america. Just sayin",
			"But it will collapse whole civilizations and destroy most equatorian agriculture. California is slated to get hit with even more droughts this year, and we could see the failure of their agriculture within the decade. Leaning into climate change to beef up Canada is dumb as hell, because taking huge players out of the economy will lead to stagnation as the global pool of capital decreases. Economic forecasts for extreme climate change (where the tropics of cancer and Capricorn are more arable) will lead to an about 9.5% dip in global gdp, and that‚Äôs if no major powers go under from it.",

Amazon didn't make a profit for years and mooned.  How many stocks go up up up with negative earnings?  This is just a reframed growth story.  Struggle now, big market share in the future.",
			"Literally everyone understands this dumbass. But Ford is not Amazon. Most stocks aren't Amazon. There isn't insane growth potential to outweigh the negative earnings. We are at the same levels as October last year with far worse future outlook.",

			"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/",
			"Exactly, individually companies seem appropriately valued. S\u0026P might be buoyed by AMZN and others with huge market caps, so if you‚Äôre just looking at the aggregate, it might seem like we‚Äôre overvalued, but it‚Äôs really not the case when you look at specific equities.",
			"Ford isn't and I never said it was. The S\u0026P is. Before someone yammers about tech and healthcare, that's only about a quarter of the index. And tech has been trading sideways and down this week. Restaurants that have been shut down for weeks like Starbucks are within 5% of October.",
			"I love it when people say this at the moment. When are we comparing to? Give me a time. Sure we are in the future but WHEN in the future do you think this economy will be as strong as it was in OCTOBER of last year?",
			"Just a reminder of last October:",
			"We were at this price AFTER the uncertainty of no rate cuts/hikes, some slow GDP growth, a waste of a trade war, and an impeachment inquiry. The market was strong enough to handle ALL of those things and start to bounce back.",
			"So, tell me... When will we be back to that level of strength economically? This rally has been built on the back of the Hypercaps ($AMZN, $AAPL, etc.). The hypercaps have pushed everything higher while the rest of the market has lagged. The question is what will happen when one of those falters?",
			"‚Äã",
			"This market isn't looking out to the future. It's just afraid of missing out.",
			"But are the hyper caps overvalued? Let‚Äôs wait to see if they significantly revise guidance.",
			"The question is what will happen when one of those falters?",
			"I know people like to say it here, but [hypercap] STONKS ONLY GO UP",
			"That was the bull case before the lockdown also fyi",
			"What metric regarding the future of our economy makes you think that there's anything good about it? Wages down, healthcare coverage down, desperation up, hours worked up, housing prices up, consumers are getting killed.",
			"Because things are not going to be the same in a few months or a year or even 2 you fucking retard bull and we don't need chipotle going to all time highs when you can't even get a burrito from them that's what's wrong with this market. All that's happening is government is giving everyone debt but you still have to pay it back that is going to prevent people from  buying Teslas and all their other spending habits they developed over the last 10 years.",

			"As for swing trading options, I'd say most. I've significantly increases my portfolio (not as much as this guy, I have a lower risk tolerance) just doing exactly what he's talking about. Identify trends, especially on high volume traded stocks, and ride the waves. Importantly, be willing to adapt to new waves as well. I probably win on 4 swing trades for every 1 loss. The patterns do change frequently, so identifying that asap is important. Even in this fucked market, charts still can tell you info about where the stock's gonna go.",

			"Any recommendations on information to better understand the charts you are referring to and what could be considered recognizable trends?",
			"Congrats btw!",
			"How long do you hold to a losing position before cutting it as a loss? In other words if the trade is right does it mean you should almost immediately see gains?",
			"It really depends on where you think the stock is headed over long term. If I buy a call for a week out and the stock immediately tanks 20%, I'm selling asap. But if it just drops 2%, then I'll look closer at the stock. If the weekly trend has been steadily up, I'll hold. If the daily trends for the past week have shown a consistent 2% drop followed by a 4% gain, I'll hope for the best and hold. I make those decisions on a case by case basis, looking at the stock and trends and determining where I think its going to go.",
			"If the trade is right you'll see gains at the end of your trade, but not necessarily the middle. I bought GME calls a week ago and was trying to stick to my swing trade schedule, so I sold them at a loss at the end of the next day. But if I would have stuck to what the charts had already told me, instead of paper hand selling, I would have been able to ride the previous 15% gain GME had and made a ton of money. I guess in that sense, if you're confident in where you think the stock is going backed by what you know, then temporarily increase your risk tolerance and be willing to take the hit, because you'll make a whole lotta money if you're right.",
			"you sound like youre holding bags mate",
			"When do you get back in after selling the calls you hold overnight? How would you cash out when there are 2-3 consecutive green days? Eg. If you sell for a profit after SPY moons overnight the morning after, do you wait until you see a red day again to get back in, or try to get in on a dip during those green days (even though it might be at a higher price point than when you sold in the morning).",
			"I usually sell before midday. The stocks I follow have shown consistent trends where they'll hit daily highs before midday and drop afterwards. I'd say that a lot of stocks have daily patterns like that you can pick up on. If the stocks I followed usually peaked near end of day, I'd sell then. It really just depends on the patterns you've seen.",
			"As for multiple day streaks of green or red, those are where I really have to pay attention. Streaks where my options keep going further ITM I'm willing to hold longer because if the stock drops, I'm still making money. I'm not looking to catch the top, my goal is to catch the drop right after the top. That way I'm not selling at 50% of potential gains, and instead min/maxing my gains out at 70-90% potential gains. Streaks where my options keep going further OTM I usually get rid of pretty fast. I don't like seeing red and its rare that in the week out expiry date options I trade, the stock will launch far enough back in the direction I need it to to make money. I'd rather just cut my losses.",
			"As for selling and buying during streaks, that also depends. I don't like giving into FOMO so I'll let big spikes ride it out without me and try to catch puts/calls going the opposite direction once the direction reverses. Again, I don't try to time the top/bottom, I just try to identify the top/bottom as soon as possible so that I can hop in with a larger chance of gains. It does leave money on the table but it's also saved me some serious losses, so I stick to the strategy. If one of my stocks isn't slowing down by midday, I'll keep holding. And if it hasn't stopped by closing bell I'll hold until next day.",

The markets that went up bigly from 00-07 (looking at you, California) came down bigly from 08-13 (some of those markets still haven‚Äôt recovered to their 2007 levels). If I had spare cash, I‚Äôd wait until the bubble pops and then look at the markets that would have made you rich if you invested ~5-10 years ago, that had good price/rent ratios before a recent housing bubble that saw huge appreciation in property values.

Dollar cost average into dividend paying stocks paying 2-10% that will be around for at least 10 years.

If you stick to the 1% rule, you‚Äôre grossing $24k a year, likely netting around $4-6k in a year.  That‚Äôs a 8-12% cash flow return on the cash spent, plus the property appreciating at 4% (conservative af) means $10k of equity in  a year.  $14-16k a year on $50k cash investment, invested in a way that‚Äôs diverse enough that negative growth years are a lot more rare than equities investing.",

The income from my 1 rental has been leveraged into $24k of equities investment + the down payment and closing costs for a 2nd property, in only 2 years.  The next 3-5 years it‚Äôll be leveraged into a downpayment for a 3rd property.  All while the mortgage is paid for me, and the house continues to appreciate in value.

			"I don‚Äôt fuck with stocks rising. I buy on dips only. buying into stocks that have already mooned is a bad idea in my opinion. Too many people buy calls after a stock goes up 4% in a day.

Just make a few percent daily and you'll have a few million in no time. Think about this. There are 251 or 252 trading days a year. 1.015251, so 1.5% gain on your balance for a year nets you a 40x. 40x$25,000=1M.",

			"Yeah you didn‚Äôt read it all. I said pay it off after they graduate. If they don‚Äôt graduate let them sink with their bad choices. I‚Äôm only 36 but fuck the world has gotten so touchy feely. I‚Äôm still paying my student debt. It will be alright.",

You mean to tell me you would have known exactly when to stop? How do you know you wouldn‚Äôt have pulled out at 20k, 50k, or 100k?",

			"Holy fucking fuck.",
			"Not that big of a deal. Consider the retardation required to buy 10 cent contracts, at that point it‚Äôs a blind gamble by an idiot with no idea what he‚Äôs doing. If he made the 1.65m he woulda just lost it in 2 weeks",

Nevertheless, i am sorry and i hope you wont ruinate too much about this, because in a twisted way of looking at it, this money really never quite existed, as it was not realised.\nWhat is your game plan now going forward?",

In a way it helps though because it removes emotion from the equation unless you really fuck up and get margin called or something.",

			"Wait a minute?? Does options are this volatile?  Like from from 10c to 33$ in 2 days?? Wtf?? I have been trading bitcoin etc just cuz they are more volatile than stocks but holy shit i had no idea options were this volatile.",
			"If you buy a couple days from expiration and way out of the money they can be incredibly cheap because of how unlikely a stock is to move 10+% in the span of a couple days. Then when it happens, they're suddenly at the money and can be worth 20x as much. This is a combo of them being near value and that massive increase in volatility.",
			"The opposite is true now, since recent volatility has been so crazy high most options are overpriced, since that is factored in and future volatility is unlikely to meet the precedent. When volatility was crazy low and mooned in a couple weeks time was when options were going crazy.",

Now sack the fuck up and throw it all into July 150p, those mother fuckers peaked at $10/each during the first drop and they‚Äôre trading for $.30 right now. That means, if we get another Vixsplosion before the middle of July, you will MORE than recover your losses. Don‚Äôt be a fucking pussy, you‚Äôve already come this far. Also, consider this: if you pull that last 32k out, and I end up being right, and you miss out on winning your money back, you‚Äôre legit gonna need some $rope. DON‚ÄôT BE THAT GUY.",

			"Well the danger there is that the dip might keep dipping... people keep throwing around words like ‚Äúdepression‚Äù lightly. I don‚Äôt think people really understand the implications of something like that, though. Like, some people are saying spx could go to 800... spy to 80. Think about that. Makes me nervous about trying to time the bottom.",
			"Yeah but those crazy OTM SPY puts only got to $10 because the VIX was at 80+. We are past peak panic. We are more into the sadness phase. The market was in complete free fall. A 30 point drop in one day with massive uncertainty. Now its certain that the economy is fucked but the Fed will print any amount of money necessary to save stocks.",
			"Correct, they only got to $10 because VIX skyrocketed. My thesis is that VIX will skyrocket again, and it will go even higher this time. Despite the Fed‚Äôs printing, there is a global dollar shortage that will trigger a financial crisis much more severe than 2008... when that hits, VIX will go to 90+. If it doesn‚Äôt happen in the middle of June (window dressing period), I‚Äôll roll my puts out, because it‚Äôll happen in September. Either way, it‚Äôs happening, and when it does happen, there will be true panic in the markets.",

			"From Samuel Butler's \"The Way of All Flesh\":",
			"No man is safe from losing every penny he has in the world, unless he has had his facer [blow to the face].  How often do I not hear middle-aged women and quiet family men say that they have no speculative tendency; they never had touched, and never would touch, any but the very soundest, best reputed investments, and as for unlimited liability, oh dear! dear! and they throw up their hands and eyes.",
			"Whenever a person is heard to talk thus he may be recognised as the easy prey of the first adventurer who comes across him; he will commonly, indeed, wind up his discourse by saying that in spite of all his natural caution, and his well knowing how foolish speculation is, yet there are some investments which are called speculative but in reality are not so, and he will pull out of his pocket the prospectus of a Cornish gold mine.  It is only on having actually lost money that one realises what an awful thing the loss of it is, and finds out how easily it is lost by those who venture out of the middle of the most beaten path.  Ernest had had his facer, as he had had his attack of poverty, young, and sufficiently badly for a sensible man to be little likely to forget it.  I can fancy few pieces of good fortune greater than this as happening to any man, provided, of course, that he is not damaged irretrievably.",
			"You took your hit to the face young enough to have the time to recover. If you'd never invested in Bitcoin, you might even have less than the $32k you have now. Take this as a lesson.",

High risk high reward trading (like when your options strategy is \"buy calls\" or \"buy puts\" and iron condor sounds like a torture device) can land you thousand baggers sure, just as easily as it can hit you with zero baggers. It's likely that you can do very well for yourself taking extreme pleb positions like \"long on stocks\" and \"dividend reinvestment plans\" and buying into a few swing trades or undervalued stocks per year, which you identify yourself.",
			"Most of the time, taking the advice of others, or of forums has resulted in me getting fomo and making scared money moves with thousands of dollars, losing on trading fees as well as percent losses, and generally taking a toll on my mental health. The companies that I find and invest on with my own DD have done well. It wasn't a huge position but I made about 40% in a couple months on a fabric company I found.

In this week's edition of DDDD (Data-driven DD), let's look at what the market's might be heading in the near term by looking at the past few week's price actions, and potential catalysts for the next trend.",

			"It looks like we‚Äôre past the ‚Äúpanic‚Äù phase of the shock, where a combination of a liquidity crunch and uncertainty about the future caused a rapid selloff. Fiscal and Monetary policy caused a rally, as price started consolidating towards the channel we are in now. It looks like most investors seem to be holding off from trading while they wait for more information, which we will be seeing over the next few weeks, starting from this week. It‚Äôs waiting for some big catalyst.",
			"Things that will cause SPY to fall below 272 and have another selloff",
			"Things that might cause SPY to rally past 293",
			"I‚Äôm personally bearish overall, and think that the catalysts that will cause us to break out towards the downside is much more likely than the upside. In the meanwhile, we‚Äôre going to see smaller companies, especially ones with weak balance sheets, underperform.",
			"This week will be important because of earnings and GDP, two key figures that should be basis of a stock's value. If we don't break the channel by the end of this week, SPY will likely stay between 293 and 272 for a while as more COVID-19 data comes in. You can play this by either going #cashgang, #thetagang with short-dated iron condors, or long-dated SPY puts if you want to take advantage of the low VIX and believe (like I am) that we aren't going past 293. If the results from this week is bad enough for us to break 272, the next selloff has started and shorter-dated SPY puts might print. Except for the unlikely case where Congress approves the Fed to start buy equities, it'd be hard to see anything that pushed us past 293 in the short term.",
			"TLDR; If we end this week \u003c 272, SPY 270p 5/15. If \u003e 293, the world has gone insane. Otherwise, selling short-dated iron condors, holding cash, or SPY 250p 8/21.",

			"One thing, why does every keep referring to the CARES act as 2T when it's actually ~6T? Does the 500B leveraged up to 4.5T for large corporations not count? I thought the leverage for this was coming straight out of the FED? Is the overwhelming assumption that most businesses will pay that back so the leverage will eventually make it back (and I assume be whisked away to nothingness)?",
			"It costs taxpayers $2T. Here's a dumbed down version of what the $500B was used for:",
			"Treasury gave Fed $500B of equity to set up an SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle). You can think of this as the government \"investing\" $500B into a hedge fund that the Fed sets up. The Fed then uses the $500B as equity (collateral) to lend the SPV up to 4.5T (10x leverage). This is the equivalent of the hedge fund borrowing buying securities on margin. The SPV can now use that money to buy assets using up to 4.5T of liquidity, but they can only lose up to $500B. If they come anywhere close to that the SPV would probably have to start delevering, but the idea is that the existance of an SPV itself would boost investor confidence to prevent that from happening.",
			"Thanks for your explanation, my point is that why is this additional risk not being represented -- what you've explained is how I was thinking about it already. The assets the SPV is going to be used to buy are very likely toxic at present, if not close to it. Representing this as a simple 500B of funds is misleading.",
			"Taking your dumbed down analogy -- taking 500B of tax money to open a  10x leveraged portfolio in the middle of quite possibly the greatest downturn this century is an incredibly risky proposition. The cost to the tax payer can absolutely be more than the principal, as that's how leveraged investing works, if the drop is swift enough -- if there is a market rout and they go way past what would normally be expected to be the maintenance limit who gets margin called? A loss of ~10% of those assets will instantly send the equity to 0, which is at least in theory possible with some other bad development. An 11% loss and now the tax payer is on the hook for more than the borrowed amount.",
			"I understand the actual mechanics don't necessarily work this way, as I'm thinking of it in a simplified way and I have not read the charter or SPV documents in detail, but leveraged investing with taxpayer money during a downturn due to non-economic factors (which makes predictability even more difficult) seems like a great way to lose that levered money.",
			"Fine, the cost today is 500B, but that characterization doesn't seem to properly represent the insane risk of 10x leverage in this environment.",
			"Because stonks only go up. Companies take the 10x leverage, put it into TQQQ, wait a few days, and now have 100 trillion bucks. Boom, recession over. Everyone retires with three maids and a driver.",
			"Theoretically (I have no idea how the Fed would react to this), if the bonds lose 100B in value and the have max leverage, they would need to start deleveraging (i.e. margin call). So if the equity they have left is 200B, the max the can buy is now $2T. That means that its unlikely the Fed would actually use anywhere close to that leverage, and also if they do and lose money, they lose equity and hence need to deleverage.",
			"Oh yeah, I fully agree -- if the loss is gradual enough for them to get a chance to deleverage slowly, what they have to do is very clear.",
			"My assumption actually was that  they'd actually just freeze and ask for more money from Congress, no idea how they'd handle it either, will definitely get written into the history books.",
			"There's no such thing as a 2nd wave in Singapore, the high numbers are all isolated in a \"labour dorm\" full of low income foreign workers who's basically isolated in a giant bubble now.

			"let's talk about  using Hydroxychloroquine on a viral infection. Hydroxychloroquine is known to help with treating cases of malaria. Malaria is a protozoan PARASITE (Plasmodium Falciparum). It is not a virus. the actual size of these two disparate entities is literally about 5 orders of magnitude. There is no fucking way that Hydroxychloroquine would help work to stop/prevent/treat COVID-19. Even their genome sizes are diffent; Cov19 has about 32 Kb of data, whereas Malaria has 22 Megabytes on 14 chromosomes. Sheesh, so many smart dumb people in this world.",
			"Bay Area, California has already extended shelter in place until end of May. Not sure where you're hearing about it ending mid-May. Cuomo said that regions of New York STATE may start reopening around then, but NYC is likely to see restrictions put in place past then. This post is nonsense",
			"The Bay area shelter in place orders were announced a few hours ago. Most of this info were random facts I found and collected in a doc during my free time reading the news on the weekend, so that wasn't announced by the time I actually wrote that.",
			"It was announced about 11 hours ago, sure. But you're still completely wrong about NYC. What you said is true about the state, but not the city. Cuomo specifically said the restrictions in NYC will likely extend past May 15. It was also pointed out that what you said about China is completely wrong.",
			"The news that Cuomo might not release lockdown on May 15 for some parts of NY (implying NYC, but he never named it) also seemed to have come out ~13 hours ago. Also, could you link the source about China not lifting their version of lockdowns (i.e. all businesses closed, can't travel between cities, some people are literally locked into their homes)?",

You can't just let your options sit there.  No one can predict the future, so if you get your positions wrong you have to work to get out of the hole to flip it into a profitable trade, or to stop the bleeding at least by managing your deltas."

			"Easiest way to make tendies.  HD didn't miss earnings as much as the street was expecting, therefore it will go up.  Just ignore the fact that a large chunk of revenue for HD comes from its financial arm, which has lent out huge amounts of loans to subprime borrowers with credit scores below 640 (i.e. biker gangs) during an economic maelstrom.  Also ignore the fact that a large income stream for HD comes from selling $40,000 heavy bikes that are almost exclusively ridden by geriatric Boomers still pretending like they're Jack Nicholson in Easy Rider - a customer base that's dying off.  $HOG is already up premarket. Should have bought calls.  Bears gonna get reamed today.",

			"Yeap.  I'm a motorcyclist and HD is seen as a cringe fiesta brand.  I would maybe consider HD if they focus on their target audience,  by introducing a trike with oxygen tank holder.  Otherwise their customer base is dying out and they're not doing a good job convincing a new generation to buy into the brand.  I don't ever see myself buying a harley when I feel like theres much more desirable and quality options coming out of Japan and Europe.",
			"I'm also a motorcyclist and hate harley BUT if i'm being dispassionate here the company has large financial reserves to weather the storm, they came out with a new electric bike that actually got good reviews although it's expensive (LiveWire), there is an entire show coming out that will shill the LiveWire (\"long way up\") and although it's boomers in the USA who ride HD, it's a status symbol in much of europe and asia where rich people still end up existing even during downturns.",
			"TL;DR I hate harley personally but don't think they'll crash like these autists are predicting",
			"No one is going to watch Long Way Up. The allure of Long Way Round was that they were doing something you could, get a BMW and ride around the world. Almost no one does that, but you could do it. No one can get an electric hog and have a truck full of batteries follow them through South America.",
			"yeah I agree the whole premise is retarded. oh i can ride an electric bike if i have a full support entourage full of batteries? what if i also have my own C-130 dropping support packages ahead? how about my own satellite constellation re-targeted to map terrain for new threats? then it'd be even easier I guess.",
			"they should've gone with hybrid bikes or something if they wanted to be unique.",

			"They totally forget that riders age into the Harley Davidson demographic. For the most part, Harley Davidson doesn't build the type of bikes that appeal to younger riders. Younger riders tend to prefer a more performance-oriented motorcycle. Those who keep riding when they get older, tend to want a bike that is more comfort-oriented.",
			"Harley Davidson builds touring bikes and cruisers that are based on touring bikes. If you like sportbikes, you are unlikely to enjoy riding a Harley. Harley's don't handle like a sportbike; rather than being flickable, the frame geometry is such that they \"want to\" go straight and stay more upright than a sportbike.",
			"I've always loved everything on 2 wheels. I've owned lots of roadbikes over the years. I got my first mountain bike when they first started getting popular. I had a motocross motorcycle before I was old enough to get a driver license, and got a streetbike as soon as I was old enough to get licensed. I've always had an appreciation of Harley Davidsons, but when I was young, it was sportier bikes that I wanted to own.",
			"One of the bikes I currently own is a Road King. I joke that it is my wife's bike, cause she was the one who really wanted a Harley. I like it far more than I though I would. It is a great bike for riding two-up.",
			"Years ago, I had a young kid working for me who rode a sportbike. I spoke with him recently and he told me that he now owns a Harley. I said \"I remember you saying that you could never see yourself on a Harley. What happened\".",
			"He laughed and said \"I got old\".",
			"I've ridden all sorts of cruiser bikes. My dad owns a Road King. Personally, the Road King feels like a piece of shit compared to the cruiser options from Yamaha like the V-Star or the Eluder which retail for much less",
			"There is a bigger learning curve to ride a bike with laid back frame geometry. I though the Road King would ride more similarly to a Gold Wing I used to have, but it is very different. You can't muscle a Harley around, you gotta learn to work with it.",
			"which retail for much less",
			"New Harleys are not a good value compared to most other bikes. You're paying for that American Made thing. However, if you buy used, they aren't terrible. And if you consider resale, they can be  become very affordable. The original owner took a big depreciation hit on the one I have, but I could sell it today for close to what I paid 5 years ago.",
			"Yep, all the Jap bikes do the whole cruiser thing ten times before for 1/4 the price tag.",
			"Have you ridden the Indian chief yet?",
			"IDK about that... Might have been true 20 years ago but now there is the ADV segment for those who age up. Also... other brands make good cruisers now (Yamaha, Triumph, etc.). I don't doubt it will continue going, as a brand it has staying power - but marketshare?",
			"This is actually very interesting, all the people say the boomers are going to die out are funny, there will always be ‚Äúboomers‚Äù just next generations worth with sore backs and money",
			"I was working in the Harley aftermarket industry so decided to buy a Harley and ride to Sturgis.  I wanted a bagger - something for touring.  I have always been a sport-bike guy.  That said I ended up putting as many miles on the bagger as the sport bike!  Also, for 2 up riding, the bagger is great.  Also when I bought the bike the salesman was surprised someone as young as I was at the time wanted a bagger.  Also also my dad commented that the bike cost more than what he paid for his house originally!",
			"Many young people don't even bother getting drivers licenses these days. They just don't care about cars at all much less about motorcycles.",
			"I don‚Äôt ride, but why would someone choose a Harley instead of say a triumph or Indian cruiser if they didn‚Äôt want some Japanese cruiser?",
			"I've been hearing \"The Harley generation is dying off\" all my life and I'm 62. They said that when I was a teenager, they will be saying that when I'm long dead and gone.",
			"They totally forget that riders age into the Harley Davidson demographic. For the most part, Harley Davidson doesn't build the type of bikes that appeal to younger riders. Younger riders tend to prefer a more performance-oriented motorcycle. Those who keep riding when they get older, tend to want a bike that is more comfort-oriented.",
			"I'm glad for you, but over here in the real world where we look at actual facts and not what you've overheard, the average age of a new Harley purchaser has skyrocketed in the last few decades.  The stopped publishing that information directly since 2009 (because it looked so atrocious), but the pattern before that was extremely clear and does not, at all, even a little bit match your experience.   The average rider is quantitatively much older today than it was when you were a teenager.  By a lot.",
			"This isn't just Harley.  The average age of a motorcyclist in general  has been increasingly sharply.  It's a hobby or lifestyle that has struggled to gain a foothold in recent generations.  A quick google shows that the average motorcyclist in 2001 was 40; in 2010 almost 50.  When you were a teenager the average rider was probably a young man.  Young people today don't prefer sport bikes - they increasingly don't ride motorcycles at all.  Sales have cratered industry-wide.  The whole \"can Harley capture the younger rider market\" kind of misses the forest for the trees - \"Does the younger rider market even exist anymore\" is a better question.",
			"Don't make financial decisions based on gut instinct and anecdotal experience, folks.  The industry has been targeting a demographic that has aged dramatically over the last 30 years or so.",
			"long way up",
			"Oh man I really enjoyed Long Way Round and Long Way Down. I didn't even know this was coming soon. I thought it had been paused indefinitely.",
			"Harleys is a symbol of boomers. Let it die.",
			"That explains all the young people I see riding them. By young I mean 30 somethings.",
			"Harley has actually been making a major push to snare young people who literally know nothing about motorcycles. I went and took the MSF course through them its a huge sales pitch. I have noticed them giving bikes to influencers and shit now too. Considering HD motorcycles are like twice as much as a better bike from someone else snaring the noobs is their best bet.",
			"They came out with a couple entry-level bikes built too and international versions are made in India - so dirt cheap production costs selling a 'premium' lifestyle brand.",
			"isnt that the street 500, thats the bike they trained us on in the starter classes.",
			"yes!  They used to use the Buel Blast - which was an awful bike with one cylinder chopped off a Sportster.",
			"I'm a motorcyclist who is in his mid-thirties. My idiot friends from rural areas love HD. I can't figure it out beyond it's what their parents talk about/own.",
			"From my city boy eyes they are all just on a bandwagon of brand with little to zero knowledge of bike manufacturers and variations.",
			"Am in a rural area, Harley is the only one that teaches the motorycle safety course to get your license. They also coincidently teach that everything but harley sucks.",
			"Well it's your job to convince your idiot friends to stop buying HDs. Or else how is the bear gang going to print tendies with HDs stock?",
			"Indian bikes are stealing that crowd. Not gonna lie the scout sixty is one sexy cruiser. Almost bought one but went with the new royal enfield continental gt instead.",
			"The scout bobber singlehandedly put me onto cruisers. I love my Daytona and I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything, but I think I see a scout in my future as well",
			"Yep, my buddy got a good deal on a Fatboy and rides the shit out of it, definitely not your typical Harley guy either.",
			"I noticed as a rider I see less and less bikes on the streets in general. Im guessing beside demographics and etc alot of development patterns have made owning a car more desirable than a bike. At least in the US.",
			"Okay Zoomer",
			"Who wants to spend big money on a livewire though, it's an expensive concept bike it's not going to sell well",
			"I had a guy trying to convince me to buy a Harley. He couldn‚Äôt name one plus to it over my Honda except that it‚Äôs a Harley.",
			"I am a 27 year old and I own a Harley. It's my second one, and I got my first at 23. (Both used) I think there is still plenty of time for Harley to do the right thing, even though they're misguided.",
			"There are plenty of negatives, but let's look at positives:",
			"they're finally working towards younger customers. (Many bikes sub-$10,000).",
			"they're diversifying their image, with Livewire, Bronx, and Pan-America models. While it's a long road, that along with their Street line, makes them an option to more people. (I know these are all likely over-priced models, but I believe cost will begin to trend downward as sales continue)",
			"they're holding motorcycle classes, using Harley models. There are many people who don't know motorcycles well, and so they only really know about Harleys. To these outside people, Harley appears to be the only option. (These are the same people who wouldn't even know BMW and Honda make motorcycles)",
			"Harley is in a bad spot, but they aren't going anywhere all that soon.",
			"as cringe as it maybe those events where they literally hand out free beer and bbq and have bikini models really do attract a lot of people, they arent the kind of people I want to know but that kind of person really likes it.",
			"I've never been to one with Free beer, but it would sell me pretty hard.",
			"we found the gay bear",
			"I am definately a gay bear but I went to the Jpowell conversion therapy camp of loss and now identify as a straight bull.",
			"it's ok if your wife is a man as long as she has a boyfriend",
			"Not a motorcyclist but I cringe whenever I see some 40+ year decked out in HD gear revving his bike for attention",
			"Big yikes",
			"Motorcyclist here, I cringe whenever I see a \u003c30 year old wasting their youth on a blinged out purposely crippled bike when they could be riding essentially half a lamborghini for $3K",
			"Hell my Multistrada is a sport bike and a continental cruiser wrapped in one and it still costs less than some 800 pound lump with chrome bits vibrating off.",
			"The irony here is Harley almost purchased Ducati",
			"blinged out purposely crippled bike",
			"I have no idea what this is referencing",
			"Harleys",
			"They can't turn for shit without scraping the expensive chrome bits. The geometry is purposely shit",
			"Also they use an outdated inefficient engine design for the sake of aesthetics",
			"Or a gsxr with a 10' swing arm extension and neon lights",
			"At least they're cheap and fast, if trashy as hell",
			"Busa or ZX-14, go for it, but to ruin a perfectly good sportbike is just wrong",
			"Whatever bro, I'm totally going to take it to the strip one day.",
			"Open your window, fake a genuine concern, and ask \"is your bike alright?\" Makes them feel stupid.",
			"I like to wait for the stationary revving to cease and then yell ‚Äúwhy are you revving an air cooled motor at a standstill?!‚Äù",
			"Cries in dry clutch.",
			"The Harley of today is Ducati. It's the bike that young motorcyclists aspire to. They also weigh half as much and have twice the power of Harleys.",
			"And their exhaust note is sex on a stick and not patented.",
			"The first time I saw a Ducati I came in my pants.",
			"I didn't even know I wanted a motorcycle until that 748 pulled up next to me.",
			"Under 30, 848 Evo gang",
			"Why is HD cringe fiesta? It's fan club is hella gay but the mid-range bikes themselves (sporties and softails) are good.",
			"define \"good\"",
			"Look good, sound good, powerful enough. Decently reliable (especially sporties). Good resell price. Great aftermarket.",
			"There's still nothing about those bikes that makes them better than Ducatis.",
			"You want resale price? Scramblers that cost $7900 in 2015 are reselling for $6500 five years later. That's $25 a month in depreciation, less than I spend on lunch in a week. I'm kicking myself that I didn't get one.",
			"What if you think Ducatis don't look or sound as good, though? Style is important. If Ducati made a street bob that looked exactly like a street bob does now, sure I'd buy it.",
			"I don't think it's absolutely necessary to go for bang for buck in specs. Harleys are certainly not the best buy for your money, but that doesn't mean they're not good. For $9k (883) I get a nice, reliable bike that looks how I want it to, sounds great, and already has twice the power-to-weight ratio of my car.",
			"If you like it then enjoy it. They're just heavier, slower, and more expensive than another bike already considered expensive. They're all mostly toys anyway.",
			"All air cooled V-twin 2 valve engines sound good, country of origin be damned. :)",
			"sound as good",
			"This my friend is a subjective opinion, but objectively you are just wrong. Ducatis sound like a piston and cylinder all-night sex orgy and I'm sure most self-respecting motorcyclists would agree. The higher RPM limit on a Ducati twin is just that much better sounding IMO",
			"The Harleys by comparison just have that odd-firing Harley V-twin sound you hear from every Harley top to bottom and most of the obnoxious Harley riders just straight pipe them, which makes them annoying as fuck to listen to (never mind that they rev the piss out of their shit engines at every red light)",
			"A 90 degree race inspired v twin sounds elegant and inspired to me too.",
			"Harleys sound like an expensive way to turn gas into noise.",
			"Where can I buy ass-less chaps? Asking for my girlfriend.",
			"All chaps are ass-less. Otherwise they would be called pants.",
			"hello fellow biker autist, you got any options in other bike stocks? harley was the only one on my radar",
			"they're not doing a good job convincing a new generation to buy into the brand",
			"They locked into the target audience of middle to late-aged, overweight, white conservatives.  Then they act surprised when the James Dean image doesn't hold true to what we expect the brand to be.",
			"Fuck H-D, I'm almost 40 and would rather ride a fucking moped.  If I ever bought a bike it'd be one of a dozen smaller, better brands that actually update their designs more than once every 30 fucking years.",
			"Yeah, HD is currently seen as lame.  They have major branding issues.",
			"But what does that actually mean for them as an asset?  Their balance sheet still looks surprisingly strong and they'll have a fair bit of time trying to right the ship.",
			"Analyzing the stock from the perspective of \"it's culturally out right now, so it must be dead\" is frankly pretty stupid.  Products come back into style all the time, and a trading strategy that just looks at what's currently fashionable is going to miss out on a lot.",
			"They're looking increasingly attractive to me if they can weather this immediate storm, solely for balance sheet reasons.  Also - they're one stupid \"hipsters ironically riding Harleys\" trend away from blowing up big time.",
			"How old are you? Actually asking for demographics",
			"This is not the place for you to troll for boypussy you creep.",
			"Bussy.",
			"This bussy is 33 y/o",
			"They're overpriced gas guzzlers. Only a boomer would pay 20k for a motorcycle just because it's customizable",
			"Indians love Harleys",
			"I bought a Harley last year because I always wanted a motorcycle and I‚Äôm selling it this week. Honestly lots of fun and they hold there value second hand but brand new for 25k is fucking nuts",
			"Any motorized toy is a much, much better deal if you buy one gently used.",
			"plus they moved ta europe",
			"Anyone who is slightly more optimistic than the market average?",
			"I agree.",
			"But betting against the consensus and being right is how you make real money in equity markets. My bagholder buddy has flipped almost 50% profit just trading volatility week over week on cruise and air lines in past 6 weeks.",
			"it's dying because boomers are dying. who would buy a Harley Davidson when they can buy a Zero all electric bike with a Tesla cybertruck engine ... Zooooom",
			"As long as boomers exist to make terrible financial decisions and whine in the internet from their goverment-subsidized trailers about how soft the current generation is, HOG will always be in business",
			"Good.",
			"If i buy it, maybe it'll accelerate its demise (all my picks are shitty)",
			"Yeah, but what about their üé∏c-c-c-cool guyüé∏ leather jackets?",
			"Jeff Lowe gave HD tons of free advertisement when he sported one of their classy leather jackets while he stole that big cat prison from that Homosexual singer/songwriter/politician/gun enthusiast/lifestyle promoter/murderous zookeeper.",
			"I just envision a bunch of middle aged men who own Harley's convinced themselves to buy some stock.",
			"I'm into bikes and harley may be able to turn things around. They have two completely modern and by all accounts quite good bike about to go on sale, one of which is basically the only good full size electric motorbike anyone has made so far. If they don't fuck it up there is a chance they can escape their self-inflicted boomer curse.",
			"Are you referring to the Live Wire? If so, Zero Motorcycles are leaps and bounds better and cheaper than the Live Wire.",
			"\"the only good full size electric motorbike anyone has made so far\"",
			"Expensive and terrible range, doesn't compare well with existing electric bikes. On top of all that, traditional Harley riders prefer noisy, rough running gas bikes.",
			"Basically a complete failure.",
			"Maybe their target market with the LiveWire isn‚Äôt the traditional Harley consumer?",
			"All their old fat riders will be dead or on respirators by the end of this.",
			"Dude the stock is up almost 15% what the fuck is this shit. Is there any point to earnings reports?",
			"No matter how bad this market screams at me that numbers don't matter and to just buy dumb calls I just can't fuckin do it IT MAKES NO SENSE!!! Anyone have any meth to help me detach my brain from reality?",
			"It's the effect of ETFs indiscriminately buying everything.",
			"It makes no sense that when earnings beat expectations the stock pops?",
			"And your solution is to buy calls before earnings?",
			"Lol, you're in the right sub.",
			"Yea I see that you're right actually my bad I misread the news ticker I was RHEEEEing too hard. The company did cut their dividend and pull their 2020 guidance as well though. Do you think that justifies a 10% jump?",
			"Cutting a dividend is probably a good move for investors honestly. The business need the cash.",
			"lol",
			"In a vacuum, it's bad. But if you are a GM stock holder, you would rather the company not go under than try and pay a dividend they can't afford lol",
			"LMAO",
			"Dont bet against the fed",
			"Over the last 5 years HOG has hovered around a P/E ratio of about 12. Yesterday's earnings report puts them on pace for $1.80 this year, predicting a price of $21.60, and it's currently at... $21.78. In fact this was their best Q1 earnings report since 2017.",
			"Of course this argument breaks down when you realize that 90% of this earnings report was from before the government ordered their customer base to stay at home because a virus is trying to kill them",
			"This pos jumped 9% after hours... this is getting too crazy... how da fic it jumps like that with such bad fukin earnings? How is it not dropping like a rock after that? This is crazy!",

			"Exactly its way down.  Not that I have any idea what I'm talking about but this makes sense.",
			"Everything makes sense until it doesn't",
			"This sub is so hilariously stupid. Just makes \"priced in\" memes without actually understanding how information works",
			"Seriously, did people think everything dropped 35-50% for no reason? It's not like expectations are high for anything going into earnings. As long as they don't underperform an already low bar nothing is crashing further.",
			"Where do you think you are, r/investing?",
			"No, I'm here filling out my pick-4 while most of y'all are just throwing money on 40:1 horses wondering why you're losing constantly.",
			"So yes. That would have been shorter.",
			"You're certainly in the right place with stupidity like that. Did you even understand anything I said? I'm not sure you even understand what odds are.",

			"‚ÄúTesla determined not to renew its directors and officers liability insurance policy for the 2019-2020 year due to disproportionately high premiums quoted by insurance companies. Instead, Elon Musk agreed with Tesla to personally provide coverage substantially equivalent to such a policy for a one-year period, and the other members of the Board are third-party beneficiaries thereof. The Board concluded that because such arrangement is governed by a binding agreement with Tesla as to which Mr. Musk does not have unilateral discretion to perform, and is intended to replace an ordinary course insurance policy, it would not impair the independent judgment of the other members of the Board.‚Äù",

			"Board- \"Wow these insurance policies are way too expensive\"",
			"Elon- \"Let me see what I've got in my coin purse\"",
			"Dogecoin purse",
			"FTFY",

			"Dumb moment of the day - what is this insurance for? Is it for is the board fucks up and tanks Tesla or something?",
			"It protects the board and executives from lawsuits from shareholders and employees. Basically yes, it is for if the board fucks up and tanks Tesla. It seems like Elon offered to pay those lawsuits out of his own pocket.",
			"The key fact is that they were insured when he did the tweet.  Going forward, he is fine as long as he keeps announcements out of tweets and does standard press releases instead.  Lawsuits against standard announcements won't work because they jeopardize the entire industry, but they can target tweets since no one else is using tweets.  Judges won't care about bad rulings that only effect a single company.",
			"But isn't TSLA price action based 90% on Elon tweets?",
			"I mean, the market is based on trump's tweets, so what's the difference.",
			"It's better than that - Elon's wealth is also mostly based on his holdings in Tesla.",
			"So if there's a shitshow, Tesla falls sharply, and the board faces significant litigation, that will theoretically be insured by a pool of money almost entirely dependent on the value of the company getting sued.",
			"HMMMM I WONDER WHAT COULD GO WRONG.",
			"It's better than that - Elon's wealth is also mostly based on his holdings in Tesla.",
			"SpaceX is worth about 40Bn on the private equity caps, of which Elon owns like 55+% of, so a majority of his wealth is actually from SpaceX",
			"Perhaps, though relying on private equity valuations (aka guesses...) for an insurance pool seems... ill advised.",
			"It's not as if Elon could liquidate his SpaceX holdings at that value tomorrow if he needed to indemnify the board.",
			"Also, because of how integral Elon is to his empire, the kind of major governance related litigation that would require substantial indemnification is also likely to have a spillover effect on SpaceX's valuation too.",
			"Both Tesla and SpaceX's value is inextricably tied to Elon, and Elon's worth is inextricably tied to them both.  In a certain sense, he's practically saying that Tesla is insuring it's own board, which is not exactly considered good governance.",
			"There's nothing to say that they couldn't just get reinsurance on the position.",
			"Nice",
			"bad rulings that only effect a single company.",
			"Musk should have served time for that tweet.",
			"lol, the whole case is based on pretending secured doesn't mean the same as \"we discussed it and an informal offer was made\".",
			"In reality, those are the same, there is no standard of documentation for an announcement like this.",
			"But courts can be shit and tesla/musk can easily lose this, it is all up to a jury and he could lose simply because the saudis won't show up to court and say he made the offer.",
			"This tweet could have been announced in other ways that would have affected the market exactly the same but without any chance at a lawsuit.  This lawsuit is strengthened by tweets not being a medium anyone else was using, so it can be singled out without any worry around involving other company announcements via other mediums.",
			"Wat",
			"Insurance is going to have to pay out the settlement over his tweet.",
			"Tesla and musk pay nothing until the maximum on the policy is hit, which could be as high as 500 million.",
			"So does that mean if I sue Tesla cause stonks go down, Elon pays me?",
			"No, it means when he calls you a pedophile, he pays the settlement, not the insurance.",

			"Maybe Elon is the smart one and we‚Äôre the dumb ones?",
			"Elon is so smart he knows the foolishness of the laws and make fools of the lawmen. Like Jesus to the Pharisees.",
			"If this is fraud, Mr. SEC then was John the Baptist a prophet? And the SEC could not answer because to acknowledge in the affirmative would be to claim divine knowledge and to answer in the negative would stir the passions of the mob.",

			"For real, fuck insurance.\nBuy puts on Tsla, tweet some stupid shit, sell puts buy long dated calls, clarify on tweet. It's the Trump special.",
			"So did Tesla go private at 420 yet?",
			"Yes, in December 2019, right after the saudi royalty that promised elon to take it private raised 50 billion dollars from their 1% sale of Aramco",
			"Just because your flair says retard doesn‚Äôt mean act like one",
			"I‚Äôm not reading everything coz I don‚Äôt bet on Tesla but I‚Äôd bet is indemnity insurance for the board.",
			"Basically, companies provide this to the board saying if board members get sued for actions / decisions made by the board, this will cover legal fees and losses.",
			"The reason no one wants to insure Tesla for a reasonable rate is because musk daddy is unpredictable.",
			"Elon Musk is Tesla....just like Jobs was Apple. Hard to insure that.",
			"Don‚Äôt doubt Musky has a lot to do with it, but D\u0026O has been horrendous recently. Reached out for a policy and had 250% increase over a substantially similar policy we got in Q4",
			"Can you explain exactly what D\u0026O protects against for someone who isn‚Äôt quite on the spectrum yet? Is basically like money for lawsuits against the board if they do negligent stuff? Is it so high because insurers think covid is going to fuck companies up the ass and into the small intestine?",
			"Also to defend against shareholder suits ( class actions etc...) Failure to disclose things like that. There are also different types of DO covering individual board members. But yes the market has gone to shit",
			"Well, with the way the market is going chances are a lot of companies are going to be found negligent so it's no wonder that the insurance companies want more money.",
			"Basically. Shareholder lawsuits are a constant bug in any company's side, even the ones doing things normally (think everything from activist shareholders to strikes to violations of workplace laws by other people - in any case you're probably going to name the board in the lawsuit as well). In a time of turmoil they only go up.",
			"D\u0026O rates had generally declined from 2013 on while loss costs and security class action frequency continued to increase. With the amount of different carriers entering the space most carriers didn‚Äôt have the ability to start raising rates until the past year. Public D\u0026O still isn‚Äôt profitable with the higher rates and would continue to increase without covid-19.",
			"Teslawoukdnprobably  get a higher price this year no matter what based on the market in genera but I‚Äôd think there pricing is insanely high since Musk has a history  of making public comments without thinking and the fact that it‚Äôs a meme stock that‚Äôs valuation is detached from reality.",
			"If tesla really does have someone monitoring elon's tweets, that would make him lower risk.",
			"I would imagine every company using tweets will have to follow the same model Elon has, because what insurance company isn't going to require a legal reviewer for all tweets after seeing the lawsuit against musk?",
			"And if insurance companies charge less if you don't tweet at all, then tweets will be off the table for execs and board members.",
			"Don‚Äôt doubt Musky has a lot to do with it, but D\u0026O has been horrendous recently.",
			"https://youtu.be/GKG3gHROYvA",
			"The documentary \"Along Came Polly\" is an excellent reference for this action.",
			"D\u0026O has also been massively loss making for years now. About time the premiums adjusted. I guess someone finally twitched and everyone breathed a sigh of relief and upped theirs as well",
			"The D\u0026O market has already been adjusting premiums up around 20-50% all of last year. The current market will only make it worse as co‚Äôs start to disclose2Q results and their stocks tanks, law firms will bring suits alleging failure to disclose the severity of these disruptions to the business.",
			"Also from what I know TSLA only bought  what is called Side A insurance which is already a slimmed down version of DO insurance that does not reimburse the entity and only covers individual out of pocket board member expenses when the entity cannot indemnify them. This coverage is typically much cheaper then full coverage for the entity that most public co‚Äôs purchase. Probably before they dropped coverage they may have been paying around 10% of their limit in premium. So their 200M tower of insurance was likely around 20M in premium ..just a guess.",
			"That‚Äôs because some of these settlements are just stupidly huge. No one wants that risk.",
			"Rich people use bonds instead of car insurance too...",
			"Do you guys hate money or something?",
			"Yeah I wish I could just drop half a mil off at the bank incase I accidentally ran over a pleb in my lambo",
			"Papa Musk for POTUS!",
			"Ineligible, not US born.",
			"Like anything fucking matters any more.",
			"Rafael 'Ted' Cruz was born in Canada and he got to run.  A CANADIAN!",
			"Lying ted probably lied about his birthplace too. I bet he‚Äôs from Kenya",

			"He's Canadian! Don't believe his lyin Latin eyes.",
			"If only he were born in Kenya",
			"What are you talking about, he's whiiiiiiile he's been here he's been a good person.",
			"I mean...",
			"BOLI and COLI are pretty cool instruments",
			"So my guess is that premiums are going to skyrocket for 'essential businesses', specifically manufacturing and process industries that have a lot of workforce that works in close proximity on the shop floor.",
			"Companies are trying to protect themselves against HIPAA privacy lawsuits and not disclosing specifics about when people get sick within their facilities. If Joe Diabetus is a high-risk case, but is told to come into work because he is 'essential' or lose his job. What happens when Joe comes into work, but Carol Rona who works 3rd shift coughed on his workstation and he dies two-weeks later?",
			"Well, if the company was negligent because they aren't taking temperatures and doing deep cleanings between shifts... they are fucked.",
			"These lawsuits ARE going to happen, and they are going to be very expensive and we will see some precedence setting...",
			"To add on that. Currently, the general workplace stance is that if you get infected with Covid, it's not a workplace injury, because you could have caught it from the community.",
			"Well, if you can prove that you have been social distancing, well now it's highly likely that you caught it at work where you are in much closer contact with people. These lawsuits will be very interesting.",
			"Elon:. \"no smoking weed or calling people pedo for a year and I get how much? Yeah, I can manage that.\"",
			"I have a feeling Elon buys Tesla's with his own money, then when his stock goes up he sells shares to recoup his loses. A new form of buybacks",

			"I heard he is being in doctors from Mars",
			"Lol",
			"Shareholder derivative suit when?",
			"Insurance is socialism.",

			"Rumor has it Elon Musk is actually Chuck Norris.",
			"and the other members of the Board are third-party beneficiaries thereof",
			"When the stock goes down they going to kill him for that insurance money",
			"My father in law owned high value residential and commercial properties and never insured one of them. His logic - \"if they want to insure me they must be making money.\"",
			"This smells fishy",
			"My calls like this",
			"What's the point of getting insurance if you never plan to abuse it like a rented mule?",
			"Not uninsurable, frugal. He's basically pocketing those premiums himself, and if he dies, he doesn't care that he has to payout money to the board.",
			"More like TLSA to 1500",
			"Doesn't Berkshire do the same thing?",
			"Since Elon is the main casualty source, him insuring personally his company against himself...is not so dumb.",
			"me thinks tsla = broke",
			"Tesla isn‚Äôt broke.  They have the best manufacturing plant, their self driving tech is ten years ahead of all the other can manufacturers, he literally owns PayPal and a portion of SpaceX.  He is putting up starlink satellites and gets billion dollar government contracts to put rockets in space.  The guy will pay and pay and pay until his company makes it... which they are making great progress towards.",

			"Or Musk is a bit more savvy and sassy than most CEOs about insurance premiums.",
			"definitely sassy",
			"This is the company that claims to not spend a penny on marketing, but their 10-k shows a budget in the range of 30 million per year.... every year and it's been increasing by double digit percentages ever year over year.",
			"The non-existant SEC flagged their accounting... after Elon settled for his fraud.",
			"Strange activity in options market... someone shady off shore company buying out of the money calls, hundreds of millions of dollars, systematically...\nwhile Musk brags about burning shorty on twitter.",
			"You cant make this shit up.",
			"Fraud is the best performing asset class in modern America. That's the lesson. That's the truth. And trying to short fraud, especially now with unlimited QE... is basically non starter.",

			"If you can refute even 1 factual statement from said rant I'll send you a month's salary in the worthless digital speculative asset of your choice, btc, eth, etc. I'll break it down for you. Pull up the 10-k and ctrl+f for \"marketing\" and tell me what it says. Look up if the SEC flagged Tesla's accounting recently. Did it happen before or after Musk settled his fraud case? Is there or isn't there some company in Panama which as been buying hundreds of millions of dollars in slightly out of the money TSLA calls for the past while? Do you think that kind of action might move the price of an equity with such a limited float? Hmmm.. Is \"fraud\" or at least lets say suspected fraud, the best performing asset class in the past, let's say, five to ten years? Even if you assume some arbitrary percentage of them will blow up, simply loading up your portfolio with obvious frauds has been a massively winning strategy for the past years. It's literally an ongoing meme/joke on the street.  If you were literate I could show you the numbers.",
			"Lmao, I literally don't give a fuck, I just found it amusing that you were mad enough at Musk to post a rant, I now see that you're just actually a fucking weirdo who seems to be one crisis short of a mental breakdown.",

			"Liquidate premarket and send off sell signals to all the algorithm traders!",
			"Tl;dr sell options that get assigned to get near infinite leverage so you can turn a $300 trade into $21k",

			"This won't work as expected if $2M goes over your initial margin requirement.",
			"Wait. WTF? You can get assigned OTM options???",
			"Turns out it's not the closing price that defines ITM/OTM (or in case of SPY the price at 4:15pm), but rather if it goes in the money after hours before the deadline for execution so that it's worth for someone to execute it. It makes sense, but surprised me :)",
			"Ah, ok, so if I understand you correctly, the reason you got assigned was the because SPY traded itself to ITM after hours.",
			"Yeah, actually this answers a burning question I've had ever since I realized a couple of weeks ago that options contracts don't actually expire until the next day (usually Saturday) at like noon-ish and I wondered about this exact scenario happening. I assumed (hoped) that they would take the underlying's price at 4:15 as the final chance to exercise but I guess not. That's horrific. Glad you got out of it with a lucky profit though.",
			"Now I'm also wondering if it's possible to exercise/be assigned options that are OTM, too? Does anyone know the answer to that?",
			"You can manually exercise options at any time before they expire. So if the underlying moves after market you can just exercise. If it goes itm three weeks before expiry, you can just exercise. It's what blew up box spread guy. I guess you can just exercise otm but that's painfully retarded and would hope your broker will try to stop you",
			"BTW you can't do this on RH, so it's another reason to ditch that app.",
			"I knew you could exercise ITM before exp but never thought about OTM. That‚Äôd be so funny to see while sitting on the other end of that trade, lol. Like uhh I guess I‚Äôm buying a bunch of $TWTR at $25 and immediately selling it for $29? Sure!",
			"Would not have known this either. What is the actual deadline for someone to execute?",
			"Also answers something else I've wondered with options...If you sell an ITM option there's a chance the other person may not execute it, it would appear.",
			"If the closing price is 0.01 in the money, it will get auto executed.",

			"No, total was 332 :).",
			"I don't have enough margin, which is why I'm surprised they didn't liquidate themselves.",
			"They need bag holders u r fuck",
			"Futures are at 2900, OP lucked out.",
			"This is interesting. Usually you get a fed call if you don't have enough margin to buy that much. They could restrict your trading until you meet the call. Otherwise everyone would do this to get a higher leverage.",

			"Props for getting out of it green. Getting assigned your first time is never fun, and especially nor for 2m.",
			"Haven‚Äôt had my coffee yet, but i thought the short options had to be ITM to be assigned? And also the 04/27‚Äôs had that much extrinsic after 3? That‚Äôs interesting.",
			"It‚Äôs best practice to close out condors at expiry.",
			"The way I understand it now, is that they need to be 0.01 cents in the money to be automatically assigned, but the option holder can still manually contact the broker and ask for assignment.",
			"As to why would anyone do it as opposed to sell them in after market is beyond me. I guess some algo is pairing puts and calls it already bought?",
			"You can exercise up to 90 minutes after close. If spy moves AH, it might make sense for the counter party to exercise",
			"I believe SPY options trade for like 15 minutes after market close. Did these goes ITM for the holder after hours so he executed?",
			"Possible that SPY dropped after market for a bit under 287 and some had these puts, so decided to execute.",
			"It definitely dropped to 286 at one point AH.",
			"Thats why you got assigned.",
			"Your options can still be assigned after hours. I believe most brokers can receive instructions up till around 5:30 or 6:00pm",
			"Some brokers let you execute OTM. Say, in this scenario, the difference between the strike was 0.50, but an upcoming dividend payment on 100 shares would be worth more than that. In that case, it actually makes sense for an investor to execute OTM because they still receive a net gain.",
			"You do know how dividends work, right?",
			"Pin risk is a bitch. Glad it didn‚Äôt fuck you though.",

			"this man is what caused the pop this morning lol",
			"Never let short options expire, just close them. Couldve easily led to a huge loss. Congrats on getting lucky though!",
			"Dude.",
			"WHY aren't you trading SPX in this quantity?  It's cash settled, and is ~10x SPY.  JFC, what is wrong with people?  You could've just traded 8x SPX condors and saved yourself the potential risk.",
			"but then he wouldn't be able to walk away with that sweet 21k!",
			"On a serious note, its much safter to do SPX and less commissions",
			"How does it work that he can cover the morning after it expires?",
			"Goddamn. I hope I fail upwards as you've done here.",

			"\"If its stupid but it works, its not stupid\"",
			"\"If its retarded but makes tendies, its still retarded but tendies are a great consolation prize\"",
			"Is your account frozen or can you still trade?",
			"you were selling iron condors?",
			"i don't understand how you  were almost assigned an option that wasn't in the money",
			"You might have qualified for a Fed bailout with that level of play even if it did go tits up.",
			"I think you're on to something, OP.  Take it to the next level.",
			"how do they execute before expiry?",
			"Why don't this happen to me",
			"Just open condors and spreads using spx that way it‚Äôs only cash settled and there‚Äôs no after hours risk",
			"Are you sure Schwab does a 7:00am EST pre-market?  I've had an account there longer than you've been alive and I can only do 8:00am.  Merrill does 7:30 pre-market but you can't short after hours.",
			"lmao this boomer has boomer in his username",
			"Not sure, am basing it off of here - https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/qq/about_extended_hours_trading.html",

			"I think the lesson is close your slighty otm shorts",
			"Don't jew the last bit of dollar OR get lucky like this retard",
			"Incredibly lucky that the market gapped up today!",
			"But yes, I believe options DO NOT EXPIRE until at least around 5:00pm - 6:00pm when brokers no longer take assignment orders. On Fridays it doesn't expire until Saturday noon I think.",
			"SPY went to 286 after hours so thats probably why you got assigned in the first place?",
			"ELI5 :(",
			"next time google iron condor and reexamine the post you dumb faggot",
			"I'm in a good mood though, so I'll explain for a bit.",
			"The gist of it is that the short leg (the 287p) of OP's credit spread ended up getting assigned even though it was out of the money by 5 cents. 67 out of his 80 contracts were executed so he ended up having to buy 6700 stocks of SPY at $287 each.",
			"Luckily for the OP, SPY seems to be on the up in the pre-market, he might actually make a nice buck on this.",
			"What if he can't afford 6700 stocks?",
			"He's stated he can't afford it in another post. He'll get margin called today and will have to liquidate his shares.",
			"He can't execute the long leg of his credit spread anymore because that one's expired too, so OP's not hedged right now.",
			"So on what step did he fuck up massively on so I can repeat it?",
			"Your best bet at replicating this is selling faggy D's that are just about to hit ITM.",
			"In reality what happened to the OP is just about theta gang worst case scenario, although *if* (big if) you catch this soon enough you might still be able to get in touch with your broker and execute your long leg early into the evening in order to hedge. This would've yielded the OP a $6700 loss ($1 spread on the condor).",
			"At writing the OP should up about 25k because SPY is in the green today, but it could've very well been the other way around.",
			"/u/AlinaWarone, hey mom it's me your son, did you end up liquidating successfully?",
			"I wouldn't have decided to execute the long leg since I did not realize they could execute OTM option, lesson learned not to hold iron condors until expiry. Got extremely lucky, see the post for update.",
			"F",
			"I don't have enough margin, which is why I'm surprised they didn't liquidate themselves.",
			"He can't.",
			"Got a phone call from Schwab once while I was away on vacation.  OTM covered calls I wrote had moved into the money. They were exercised three weeks early.  It had happened before but they never called me on the phone.  It was strange.",
			"Most brokers including Schwab will auto execute anything that is profitable and even sometimes when they're not.  Why?  Might be a HTB stock...somebody is accumulating a position and they figure it's cheaper than moving the market.",
			"BTW:  Please keep in mind karma is real.  Once you get lucky a few more times please consider a donation to the charity of your choice.  Have fun.",
			"I'll risk a ban, but didn't you retard heard of demo accounts where you can practice your peepeepoopoo iron condicks and asshole spreads without actually getting fucked?",
			"I doubt demo account would behave like this - 67/80 OTM contracts got assigned, 13 expired.",
			"BAN. Demo accounts teach you nothing regarding this scenario.",
			"You behave differently when using Monopoly money vs real money.",
			"This is why I won't trade credit spreads üòÇ",
			"damn you have 2m cash or is it margin"

I‚Äôm super into valuation on stocks and the market and we are still so overvalued. There‚Äôs just nowhere else to put your money right now",

			"wait they met earnings and stocks tanked?!",
			"The stock was flirting within a dollar of its all time high you fucking dipshit. Do you think ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù is just a meme?",
			"Keep in mind meeting earnings was probably already priced in, it was practically at ATHs... would've needed to smash expectations to warrant further growth",
			"Yes these fucking market makers just trying to fuck every person out there. So fuckin fake",
			"Lol fake? they met earnings for the quarter that was nearly unaffected by the pandemic and issued negative guidance for Q2. meaning they basically said \"yah we hit Q1 but getting our shit pushed in in Q2\" combine that with an overvalued stock and you get the drop",

			"\"we are not offering guidance\"",
			"Shit! Rip call holders..",
			"i understand gains may be higher but it seems like playing AMD/big tech/spy right now is just a quick way to eat premium and lose money.",
			"SPY has been making me solid gains. VIX is low so premiums are dirt cheap (relative to while we were near the bottom)",
			"what have been your vix plays? i haven't even touched any of the major indexes, so no idea what an effective entry strategy might be",
			"Personally don't play VIX, but it directly affects the price of options. There are correlations between VIX and the price of SPY that I watch for, not 100% indicator of course but good enough for me",
			"Yes AMD stay at $53 exactly and maximize the profits on my spread.",

			"I love Pfizer even though it‚Äôs a snail. Not bashing the company, one of the most renowned pharma companies globally. Just a factory of products. I‚Äôll be getting more 40c for 2022 after we dip again. I‚Äôd expect about 55-60 range by 2022 is my prediction",
			"PFE also opened up and OP's PFE FD had a high of $0.76 on the day, OP just doesn't know how to take profits and rode the red wave instead",

			"I had the exact same ATVI position. Dead retarded, in hindsight. F",
			"I mean people are playing lots of video games and the company is doing great.  Ofc the move was to buy puts.  Calls are for the companies that are closed and can't make money",
			"Well I think the mistake I made was a combination of theta decay and Vega decay so close to earnings, and ATVI has already climbed fairly far. But the movement today was very strange",

			"Well, NIO usually follows TSLA up and down like it's stuck lips-first to TSLAs dutty bunghole, and the premiums are super cheap. Yesterday when TSLA went up 10%, NIO went up 10% on its back. It always does this. Except for today. Today, NIO decided to diverge from its usual path of following TSLA like the fucking weeabo it is and, whilst TSLA is down 3%, NIO is suddenly up 4%.",

			"Options you always have time working against you if you are long. With the ETF or just holdings stocks in general, you can afford to wait although you have to put up more capital for it and get less bang for your buck. If I did do options, I'd create a synthetic position and always be net short vs. long.",

			"I may splurge and buy a nice bottle of cognac but that's about it. I'm the type of guy who will drive another mile to the next gas station to buy gas a penny cheaper",
			"Minimum wage was $4.75 in 96, $5.15 in 97, so guessing somewhere around then. Adjust $5 even for inflation you're at about $8.10, minimum wage is $7.25. If you're older, the gulf only grows - 1990=$9.90 adjusted for inflation. Would you want to take a 10-30% pay cut for that job? Also, millennial is unofficially through birth year 96 - so you're comparing your high school self(when room and board was presumably covered by your parents) to someone 24+ who probably needs to cover all of that.",

			"They pay you to fill up your tank now, going to the next station won't be necessary, just make sure you have change for -$100",
			"I am in the FIRE movement. If i have your money, i would quit and travel the world.  It woukd kills me to sit in a cubicle until 65. My original plan was for the shorts to print then buy more stocks, but it didnt work outüò≠.",
			"Join theta gang! Sell covered calls and cash covered puts. Free money :)",
			"For sure. Actually I shorted calls on some of my SPY positions last week so they got called, but I took some off the table. Good way to take profits along the way or hedge and sell IV to someone.",
			"I tried to sell covered calls 2 times and both times the stock did a remarkable sprint up, i regretted it alot.",
			"But you won either way? Since stock price went up",
			"Very quickly, the call option i wrote got in the money. Stock went up 20 percent on a day, so all the profit on the stock is for the holder of the option from that point on. At the end the stockoption got exercised.",
			"I would only recommend writing call options if you really want to sell. If you d like to keep it, better not to do it.",
			"Ahh, so I guess a further out one wouldn't screw you over as much",
			"If you write calls it‚Äôs great if the option expires worthless. So out of the money at expiration date.",
			"But if it ends in the money you lose your stock for the strikeprice. So yes you re right writing further out would have helped me, but the premium is also much lower then.",
			"For me writing options was no peace of mind or easy money.",
			"Any time you sell a call you cap the upside. Just stagger them. The SPY has tons of calls so I'll sell some calls for the week, then sell more calls later on if I want to etc.",
			"My god I‚Äôm so jealous of you. I would literally sell weekly covered SPY 300c every single Monday and pocket the no-downside profit",
			"You can always get some money every week. The biggest risk is if the market tanks a huge amount, then the strikes you have to pick next time are much lower or else you don't get premium and you are holding a position underwater.",
			"What you do is sell staggered calls. So let's say you have 1000 shares, sell 1 call at a strike, then 1 call at another strike later on etc. The nice thing with the SPY is there are tons of calls and they are weekly.",
			"Thanks, good plan this",
			"It s a sound strategy. Think i would try to get some more real estate: to rent out or for the family‚Äôs life quality. Well played !",
			"Thanks, that's probably not a bad idea. May wait to see if real estate prices soften a bit more and may look at a few houses. I think having diversified assets, including property is a good idea along with stocks. From an investment standpoint, I still have holdings but I have largely limited myself to just broad retirement funds vs. individual holdings so I am spread out.",
			"Short-term there's probably 4-5% more on the S\u0026P-500 left, but I have a trailing stop so if it drops then I'll probably clear out the rest. If it goes up 4-5% that's probably it for me as the risk vs. reward isnt there anymore.",
			"Dude, you have $1M... that‚Äôs not really enough to invest in ‚Äúproperty‚Äù unless you mean buying half a duplex or some shit.",
			"This subreddit is so fucking dumb. One single guy with likely less than average net worth for his age shows up - and gets praised because they bought... fucking S\u0026P ETFS??",

			"And that‚Äôs still about literally the smallest time real estate I can even think of.",
			"A significant of my portfolio s stocks. I am still negative because i bought way too early. Been selling call \u0026 put and use it to buy SPY puts. Needless to say my shorts are worthless, but atleast i can say that i tried when i look back to 2020.",
			"Are you me? Everything you said is exactly me. Are you an ISTJ?",
			"Indeed",
			"I tried options last years, it‚Äôs a rollercoaster. Love the indexed ETFs. If you are confident a market is going to move in a certain direction then you make money without having the necessarily time the play precisely.",
			"People shake them because they think the yields suck... I made 30% on HMJI in less than 4 months. They‚Äôre amazing in volatile markets by calming/diversifying your position",
			"Options are easy come easy go. It reminds me of Vegas, there may be some winners, but overall more losers than winners which is why I sell them vs. buying them.",
			"Quick job after a year and retire to live off the interest.",
			"This guy made an extra 100k and you think it impacts his life? Like NOW he can retire, but without that 100k he didn‚Äôt have financial freedom?",
			"100k can buy a flat in South of Spain or Bali.",
			"No shit you retard. So can the 700k+ he started with. My point is, the extra 100k doesn‚Äôt suddenly make him financially free",
			"Leveraged 3x ?",

			"Not as sexy as 5,000% gains, but at the end of the day at least you are left with some money in your pocket.",

			"Investors are being blinded by a Fed who are building a wall of money to contain this credit crisis. Printing trillions hoping this monstrosity of bad policy will be swiftly overlooked, and for the most part it has. Never before have we seen the level of support the fed has been willing to give and investors think that is enough. When the Fed backs you, you keep pumping. Because of the broad nature of the assistance, I believe neither Mnuchin nor Powell know, or care about the actual consequences. They've cast a wide net in hopes that they've solved every problem that will come their way in this crisis. I'm not quite sure if they're stupid, or if they're drinking the same Kool-aid this admistration is pumping out. We all know its bullshit and there is no way we see new highs by Q1 of next year. BOTH Mnuchin and Powell should be on the hook for this; Mnuchin for embezzelment and fraud and Powell for accessory to it. They make Bernanke and Paulson look like choir boys.",
			"When the reality sets in, and everyone realizes there will be no V-shaped recovery, it will be too late. The bets being placed now on a speedy recovery are the final nail in the coffin and this time, the fed will be completely out of ammo.

			"1) End of Capitalism narrative has been in play since 2008 with big government bail outs",
			"2) US will continue to be world powers... idk where you get that they won't. There is simply no other country at the same GDP and military power as the US. The world won't match it for a long time.",
			"3) Everyone is printing right now. THe US is not the only one, and as long as US remains the world power, USD will continue to be the reserve currency. What currency is oil traded in? USD What currency is used in cross national trades? USD",

Are wages going to rise to meet that? What happens when someone realizes that we'll never ever repay any of this? Are you hoping that the military might will be enough to scare everyone into submission?",

And gold wouldn‚Äôt happen bc the global federal reserves are too powerful.",

			"If you look at the past, during the Great Depression the narratives were always the same. Narrative Economics by Shiller is a good book that discusses this. About how the same narrative is played out. For instance in 08 everyone talked about the Great Depression saying it‚Äôs worse than that. In 01, same thing.",
			"I‚Äôm just saying that maybe you are overestimating the issue and I am underestimating. But I just wanted you to understand that this fear that you have has always existed in every economic downturn.",

			"what happens when someone realizes that we‚Äôll never ever repay any of this?",
			"I genuinely understand your position. I don‚Äôt even think you‚Äôre necessarily wrong about what should happen in this situation. But history so far tells us a different story. We already had the inflation boogieman back on 2009-10. Turns out the printing was deflationary because the rest of the world was in trouble too and a strong need for dollars outweighed the seemingly-obvious outcome of what happens when you just wave a magic wand and create more currency. None of this quite works the way we think it should.",

			"nailed it.",
			"Yeah I think you're mostly right, but systems don't change over night and it's certainly under way. There's a rumor that Saddam was trying to switch to Euro in oil trading, that's why the US invaded. Not to pump it themselves. But conspiracies aside, that's exactly what has been proposed recently by other major players, so make of that what you want. Also, electricity/solar will replace oil in the near future as prime energy source, except for industrial applications, you can kiss the whole oil market and everything that goes with it goodbye soon anyway.",
			"We can at least all agree that the US has increasing competition from, China, and is being challenged by other state actors like Russia, although in a very covert way. But there's no avoiding that the world is changing towards pluralism and multiple big players. The US might not remain the dominant power.",
			"Exactly like in 2010.",
			"Bro u stupid, we gon blow up this this account and then just delete the app and start over. We just need a new email address.",
			"In a perfect world, you are probably right. But, you're letting your emotions get in the way of seeing facts clearly.",
			"1) It's not just the U.S. this time. Every government in the world is combatting this (primarily through money injections). The FED, along with the ECB, are printing. So, inflation/deflation is all relative.",
			"2) You are betting against the most powerful people in the world. And, again, it's not just limited to the U.S. No matter how unfair it is, I wouldn't do this.",
			"3) You are assuming the public will know the full amount of how much money was injected into the world. Want to bet that won't happen?",
			"I think velocity plays a huge part, there is absolutely no trickle down, whatsoever, so printing only inflates asset prices as it did since 2008, but inflation as measured by consumer price index which is normally done, there won't be inflation. Quite the opposite. The Fed has both raised the inflation target and missed it too. There's actually deflationary pressures right now. Look at Oil. Housing... The list goes on.",
			"The US however leads by sheer numbers, way ahead of everyone else in terms of print volume. And there's plenty other reasons the dollar is being increasingly questioned, power competition being the dominant factor, so a political and not monetary reason.",
			"\"The Fed has both raised the inflation target and missed it too. There's actually deflationary pressures right now. Look at Oil. Housing... The list goes on.\"",
			"This has been fucking with my head for the past week and a half. Still cant make heads or tails of it.",
			"It's about money velocity. In other words the speed at which money is being circulated. Wealth concentration at the top/ redistribution from the bottom to the top leaves less below at the bottom to go around. Bam, shrinking money supply where it matters equals deflationary pressure, even more so because inflation is normally measured via consumer prices. Simplified.",
			"SPY 500C 05/15.",
			"Got it.",
			"Seriously though thanks for the snippet. Printing trillions of dollars in liquidity and still encountering all of this deflationary pressure... wtf.",
			"Its partially due to the idiotic way inflation is defined. Literally a rising stock market is considered \"inflation\" same as a cheapening goods basket is deflation. Personally I believe the two should be separated into inflation which is caused by money supply/demand and inflation of prices due to supply/demand shifts. From what I understand the federal government in all its infinite wisdom just clumps them together and yell MUH DEFLATION and prints more when in reality we don't have deflation. We have slipping demand or oversupply. You CAN fix those by printing money, inflating the money supply, and therefore increasing demand. It however is kind of similar to what the USSR did until it collapsed so YMMV.",
			"‚Äã",
			"EDIT: Also increasing demand by printing money is certainly not sustainable.",
			"Bet against the world brother",
			"I'm waiting for the punch line:",
			"\"...and lose all your money.\"",
			"So I like geopolitics and macro, and there are some really interesting trends coming out of this that will play out over a longer term than you can take advantage of unless you can make big plays shorts on margin, unfortunately. Here are some events to watch out for:",
			"Tariffs on oil importing into the USA, petrodollar abandoned (Watch for more euro debt issuance by saudi, China buying oil in RMB/Rial)",
			"Anti-china rhetoric in the USA in the election cycle leading to souring relationships and pushing china to reduce US economic ties (Watch for sales of treasuries by China and or purchases of alternative assets rather than new treasuries purchases)",
			"EDIT, adding in: Aggressive Belt and road expansion especially in Africa in combination with medical diplomacy. Ideally with an improvement in financing terms that make it more palatable for international support especially from europe.",
			"Weird shit \u0026 good shit in europe:",
			"Brexit bravado from the UK getting worse (bad for the pound. Watch for European countries finding opportunities to cut UK ties eg Airbus partly shuttering welsh wing factory today)",
			"European green new deal / rebirth fund paid for by coordinated issuance: especially with significant green energy, tech, science \u0026 innovation and infrastructure investment (this would be positive for the Euro even if the issuance was massive and the EU can direct funds to be spent responsibly unlike USCongress)",
			"Decent points except for your last. Assuming the EU has the recipe to responsible fiscal policy is dangerous. Green policies in Europe still impact the legacy manufacturing sector as well. Interesting times ahead for all.",
			"The last one is just my hope to be honest with you.\nI hope that if european countries are going to write joint debt, it should be used for those things. But it would be a very very strong signal for european commitment regarding climate change and regional growth in southern and eastern countries amongst other things. If the commission can generate some harmony amongst member states, then it should mark a period of increasing sustainable european growth.",
			"What does \"commitment regarding climate change\" have to do with economic growth? Look at what French vest-wearing protestors are protesting, look at how the middle-class German citizens have been affected by Germany's green energy policies. Whether you think it's noble or not, and whether you think it will pay out economically or not in 20 years is a separate conversation from whether green energy policies are doing anything other than hamstringing the European economies today.",
			"It's part of a general investment drive that the public is generally supportive of.\nKeep in mind also we don't have enough oil or gas so we can't just burn it for fun.",
			"Gonna keep betting tho. Blow and hookers here I come.",
			"The federal reserve and federal government have made sure there is no liquidity crisis during the lockdown, which is what would have lead to a bigger selloff of equities.  Demand is very low for many things like oil for example so prices remain low.  The big question is will there be a major supply shortage anywhere?  If there is a shortage of food that is when the system is at risk.  People will be complacent through a lockdown until they start starving.",

The Roman Empire lasted around 1500 years while the US has only been around for about 250.  I pray that we last as long but we have several challenges ahead of us.

			"Tl;dr A lot of people have noticed the massive crowds at Home Depot and Lowe's of late.  This past weekend I did some Google Trends DD to see if that's really showing up numerically somewhere.  I found that HD and Lowe's are both at all time highs for search interest, with trends since February comparable to Corona plays like Netflix and Amazon, except more linear.  It's worth noting that unlike those stocks, HD and Lowe's haven't yet recovered or exceeded their pre-virus prices, although they have had a bit of a run-up today and Friday.",
			"Home Depot and Lowe's have seen a steady, sharp increase in search activity since March.  In fact it appears to be an all-time high, even more than the holiday season.  And HD/Lowe's are pretty insulated from the Amazonification of shopping- a lot of their stuff is convenience based, or bulky items, or stuff you want to check out in person.",
			"Compare to the CV19 All-Star stocks Amazon and Netflix, along with Wal-Mart to compare to Amazon as a retailer, there is a similar but more linear uptick for the home improvement stores.  And AMZN/NFLX/WMT stocks are at all-time highs.",
			"Etsy, Ebay, and Wayfair have seen upticks in search activity similar to the hardware/home improvement stores.  (Side note, in contrast to these, Poshmark took a severe hit during the onset of the outbreak- used clothing not so hot during a virus outbreak I guess- although a recovery seems to be underway). However, their stocks have mostly already recovered their pre-corona prices.  Still some room to run possibly, if you think the landscape has permanently changed in their favor.  eBay especially has potential to challenge Amazon in online retail if they can get on the right track.",
			"Just for comparison to Wayfair, HD, and Lowe's- nobody much cares about Bed Bath and Beyond right now, which is just as well since their stores are closed.",
			"Actually as it turns out, BBBY released strong online sales increases and skyrocketed yesterday, and is now up about 30% since Friday.  On that note, there is a small uptick in the search activity for Bed Bath Beyond. That could represent growth in online sales. If so, as HD and Lowe‚Äôs have much larger upticks I wonder if that could also be pointing in part to strengthening online sales, which the markets seem to love.",
			"Bottom line, the hardware/home improvement stores are tracking the hot internet stocks in terms of search interest and anecdotal feet through the doors, yet their valuations have lagged.  I wonder if the markets are overweighting the loss of construction business.  This could present an opportunity for HD/Lowe's to surprise at earnings, which is really what an earnings play is all about.",
			"Positions:",

			"LOW 6/19 110c",

			"My buddy is a contractor that does work on run-off drainage for highways and has still been working this whole time. He told me he's never seen Lowes this consistently busy in the past 3 years he's been doing this. Says he can't stand going because of the crowds and has been making his workers give him more comprehensive lists so he doesn't have to make daily trips and deal with the cluster fuck.",
			"I've used HD professionally and hated having to go there on weekends bc of DIYers clogging up the aisles. Don't get me wrong I think it's great people are doing there own work but when I go I want to get in and out fast. Every day looks like a weekend right now. They're absolutely killing it in sales and I'm sure their credit cards are selling themselves.",
			"Can‚Äôt even get into home depot. lines are half an hour all day long",
			"Literally just put in a limit order for calls cause of this thanks",
			"I work at lowes, can confirm we are busier than fucking ever",
			"Are you considering the fact that contractors and businesses aren't buying nearly as much right now? That must account for a significant portion of hardware sales.",
			"I think OP works at a store that did extremely well despite covid. Anecdotally, my contractor neighbor goes to work every day and the houses in my neighborhood still have construction going, landscapers, painters...",
			"Pretty hard to shut contractors down. A lot of them use illegal labor, have to work to keep afloat, and are fairly decentralized. I don't see them stopping until they start arresting people for not obeying lockdown, or people who have the financial werewithal to get a kitchen upgrade start feeling the financial hurt. Also I bet the downturn in the housing market sees a lot of sunk cost fallacy going on with people trying to sell their house putting in more on a remodel thinking that will get the house moved for them.",
			"This is true, mainly in the Outdoor, Plywood, and Appliance sections. All of them high margin.",

EURONAV actually DOES have one of the largest fleets in the world (About 4x that of the NAT fleet). They are also MUCH better capitalized and committed to returning 80% OF ALL PROFITS to shareholders. They have been less dilutive (NAT constantly issues equity in pump and dump schemes) and own 43 of the VERY LARGE CRUDE CARRIERS that you're seeing in the news headlines, wheras NAT owns ZERO VLCCs.",

			"Thanks for trying to help all of these folks out.",
			"Thanks! Yes, DHT risk management is excellent (they've basically guaranteed profit till this time next year) but I feel they are close to fully valued...",
			"Thanks. I like that DHT has 10 open at spot and 4 on profit share but totally get that caps some upside. I just own a wide portfolio of most of these guys to hedge mgmt.",
			"also keep in mind this audience. I am pretty sure there are some (not all, but some) bad actors at play and purposely picked a smaller market cap name in this space that had underperformed (for a VERY good reason) after making their position. Then they pumped it by writing it up. Same for YouTube audience. It‚Äôs not based on valuation, it‚Äôs based on getting a broader audience to baghold for them. Greater fool theory.",

I would listen to him carefully if you are trying to make money on a good risk-return basis. If you are trying to YOLO bet, do whatever you want. I guess I understand that too.",
			"Right, which is why I felt like I needed to call this one out. Ruining faith in the tanker trade because the most visible out there pumped the worst name? Can't let that happen. EURN is worth a lot more than it's trading for today. NAT isn't. People need to know.",

			"hmm you think EURN, FRO and TNP can also do the same? I like what OP said about EURN and spot prices.",
			"I am going with EURN and STNG so I have the best exposure in dirty bulkers and clean product respectively...it appears that the others all track SP respectively but in the event they happen to decouple I see these two as being the fundamental leaders for both genres",
			"love it nice. I am going to load up on EURN right now. Have some TNP and FRO. Might sell my TNP (up 25 percent) and invest that into STNG or EURN",
			"I like them a lot too. Good luck with your positions.",
			"How many ships does EURN have available for spot pricing? Last I heard they had 12 month contracts already lined up through 2020.",
			"EURN has over 60 ships. Only a few of them are on long term contracts. They are still mostly spot exposed. The long term contracts they did get are INSANELY good...long term storage at GREAT rates. 60k per day for a year is one of the best years a tanker will EVER have. High spot rates don't last forever and neither will this contango.",
			"$60k/day is what $NAT is getting for Suezmax Tankers, shouldn't VLCCs be double the spot price if they carry double the amount of oil? Also, not that I don't believe you, but do you have a source on the number of tankers currently available for spot charters?",
			"Appreciate your time",
			"Euronav fleet list (on their website) will show you what's on spot and what's on TC OUT. Only 10 ships of over 70 are on time charter. The rest are all on spot. $NAT is not getting 60k for a year for very many Suezmax if they got it for any. EURN has as many Suezmax as NAT does and less debt attached. There is really no comparing the two. NAT should be 20-25% the price of EURN.",
			"What are your thoughts on FRO? Was hoping they would see the most pump since they are the largest and have one of the last earnings dates of the tankers..",

			"EURN opened at $12.45 today and is at $11.90 now and hasn‚Äôt gained any major price moves since the day oil went negative. NAT and EURN had the same price points in 2015-2016. To me NAT seems like a better opportunity since it can run up more at a cheaper price compared to EURN that‚Äôs red rn and is more expensive than NAT That might only go up to the $15-$16 range. Also what‚Äôs your thesis on the correction for NAT ?",
			"SHARE COUNTS vs ASSET VALUES... It's super simple math...$EURN NAV is around $12, $NAT NAV is around $3. $EURN is worth at least 4x as much as $NAT.",
			"is it possible somewhere to find NAV number ?  couldn't find online, or have to calc yourself ?  I thought it's only for bonds backed ETFs",
			"I mean look at what he said in the post dude. NAT has a smaller fleet in general and has had a far greater run up in the market recently. There's no reason NAT stock should be as high as it is when their investor relations have been notoriously scandalous with pump n dumps. It's the same reason I decided to go with other companies as well. Problem is if I followed the hype I would have made a lot more. But based purely on fundamentals (which I understand the market is lacking in right now) NAT looks shitty at the moment compared to other big names. If you're looking to make money on hype with high risk NAT is still the play. If you're looking for a company that's going to turn over high profits and not fuck the investor look elsewhere.",
			"I don‚Äôt think anyone is counting on $NAT long term though. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people saying they‚Äôre only holding until after Q1 earnings are released, with another handful of people making calls that expire in July when Q2 earnings are announced (which is where most of the current contango profits will be). I would be surprised if anyone who bought right now is still holding come Q4 earnings. $NAT is short term.",
			"The difference is that NAT is a shit co and EURN is an actually well managed company.",
			"I've been accumulating on EURN on every dip they have as they sympathize with NAT. When I was comparing oil tanker companies when futures went negative they seemed to be the most strongest financially. Nat's a total publicity play",
			"You got it. EURN has never had a year of negative EBITDA as far back as I looked. They are extremely well managed and have a gigantic fleet despite little financial leverage.",
			"Agree, have a lot of trust in Hugo. I'm very long tankers (EURN, TNK, FRO), but two things I take seriously:",
			"Counterparty risk (Hugo himself said some time ago that they can't claim cargo as collateral)",
			"Demand shock now will probably lead to lower supply in the future. That WILL hurt tankers. That concerns the whole industry whether overleveraged or not. I'm out when the big divvy hits \u0026 will look for re-entry later... When NAT has probably ceased to exist.",
			"VLCCs = VERY LARGE CASH COWS",
			"Thoughts on OSG?",
			"OSG has a small fleet that trades Jones Act. It is a good bet and fairly valued but doesn't have the international reach and staying power that EURN does.",
			"Picked up some calls this AM. It's a gamble but high risk, high reward",
			"Not really, its a supply/demand issue. They will reap the rewards of a saturated oil mkt. its poised to pop.",
			"My thoughts as well, let's hope we're right",
			"Ditto",
			"What expiration?",
			"5/15 2.50",
			"Do you think NAT is still a potentially profitable play though? Just looking for confirmation bias due to my 40 contracts",
			"I think NAT could go up more on momentum but the market will have to stay this good for it to be a profitable long term play. Most expect the market to come in a bit and I wouldn't want to take a 50% capital loss to get 20% in dividends.",
			"If rates keep going crazy all tankers (including NAT) should trade up.",
			"In similar position as our friend with 40 contracts have 23 at 9c 5/15 and 8c 5/15 little worried tbh. Got them at 1.00 and 1.35. Should I hold? Down 16 percent",
			"Edit: I got it not a peak, but around $8.00 in the AM... it‚Äôs taking hit now",
			"he's short NAT.",
			"Yep I'm short NAT common and long puts but if VLCCs hit some of the insane rates they've been talking about in TW NAT could trade up with the rest",
			"I like the DD - bought 3000 shares",
			"Thoughts on FRO? Also, still a good time to play STNG?",
			"I‚Äôm already 2.5x on my STNG 19C 5/15 position (got in before oil went negative), but wanted to ask someone who has followed the space for opinion on whether it still makes sense to pump more in this.",
			"Also, any other tankers that have heavy US exposure? Like those better than euro exposure because WTI needs storage more immediately",
			"I would consider taking profits on short dated calls unless you're doing something to hedge...",
			"STNG is making incredible rates now. Their LR2s/LR1s are earning more than ever by a long shot (seriously they are at all time highs).  FRO took a very bullish bet on the cycle by adding a lot of debt in March to add more ships. Time will tell if they are calling it correctly. Higher risk and possibly higher reward. Close to fully valued but dividends will be massive (~$1 per quarter).",
			"Storage is a global need. Hubs are full all over. There are some big kinks in the AG / Red Sea right now around the Suez canal. Singapore, South Africa - you name the place - there are storage problems. Pure US exposure would be OSG. But remember it's not just storage driving the market but general chaos and delays as well (for example needing to wait to enter a port due to COVID19, onshore tanks being full at discharge location, etc.)",
			"Thanks for your response. I was considering selling the shorter dated calls. Target plan was to exit the position when STNG was at or close to $30. However, in any case I plan to unload the $19 calls before earnings. These are deep in the money now any way so returns aren't as stellar and I believe liquidity will also suffer.",
			"My worry is that with everyone talking about tankers now (including larger media outlets like Cramer), expectations are already baked in for a record setting earnings season for these companies. Do you believe that these companies are still undervalued given your earnings forecast? What would be your case for further upside?",
			"The only other tanker options I hold are July dated. From your vantage point, does it make sense to buy Octobers now? (And if not now, then post earnings?)",
			"STNG, EURN, INSW, DSSI all grossly undervalued",
			"Fair enough, thanks again for your comments.",
			"What's your price target for STNG and EURN? I have shares in both that I bought when oil prices went negative and I saw the opportunity. I'm thinking STNG $30 EURN $15. But I have no knowledge in this space.",
			"Edit: saw your EURN pt of $17. Also I plan on selling STNG soon (hopefully $30 a share) and then dumping all the money into EURN.",
			"Depends on rates...if product tanker rates hold out for a few more weeks STNG is hitting 40s or 50s fast...otherwise 30?",
			"They need 17k fleet wide average to pay maturities for next few years...Right now the average is over 100k which is insane...",
			"buy may calls,  theyre about to smash earnings on the 7th.",
			"Buy my June $20 strikes. Very reasonably priced.",
			"for NAT It's more than priced in",
			"What about EURN and STNG? Buying plain old \"stock\" just seems so safe and reliable. Option plays are the only thing that gets me going anymore.",
			"my FRO tanked. What a true tanker",
			"excellent dd from one of the top sources for tankers on twitter.",
			"Thoughts on ASC?",
			"Getting closer to fair value ($9?). MRs are having an incredible run (spot rates are about 5-8x breakeven depending on route) and ASC as pure play MR greatly benefits from that.",
			"ASC traded up 30% after last earnings call and I'm expecting any weakness to bounce back. With MR rates where they are ASC is one of the best plays around.",
			"You don‚Äôt think the MR rates are sustainable for a few months? If they last any amount of time ASC just takes in money... not to mention their options have by far the lowest iv... we are on wsb afterall.",
			"What about $DHT and $FRO? Frontline CEO has been super vocal about how well they are going to do this year.",
			"DHT and FRO are both going to make a lot of money and pay good dividends. However from a valuation perspective they are both pricey already. EURN, DSSI, INSW are all names in the US traded crude tanker space that have attractive valuations.",
			"Curious what metric you are saying DHT is pricey already?",
			"Add the value of the vessels and cash, subtract the debt and other liabilities, divide by the share count. Historically tankers trade for around vessel value. If less undervalued, if more, overvalued. If you model cash flows you can alter what you find in the report and figure out where the puck will be in a few months.",
			"Whats your eurn PT",
			"$17 + $4 in dividends 2020",
			"$NAT PT $4.50 and $1 in dividends 2020",
			"Tyty for sharing",
			"What should EURN reach? Because IV is pretty high already.",
			"Just buy shares.",
			"That‚Äôs a smart decision, but I‚Äôm here to gamble not make smart moves.",
			"I'm looking for $15-20 this year and strong dividends",
			"Emptied my buying power on 15c 6/19. Now jacked to the tits. Tell me this will work. I need a god damn win",
			"u/ekozie what are your thoughts on this post and NAT potentially being overvalued at the moment? I read your DD on NAT and have made plenty of gains already. I was wondering if you would still play NAT or if it would be better to switch to calls/equity in other tankers that are still undervalued like EURN, TNK or STNG.",
			"I hold some EURN and DHT, but the purest play in time charters and spot charters is still NAT.  Are they more expensive than last week?  Of course.  Am I concerned that every shitweed on youtube is now broadcasting twenty minutes of pure ostrich poo to their hordes of twelve year olds who trade on robinhood like a video game and made NAT act like a penny stock today?  Damn straight.  Do I wish I sold my calls at 3.10 this am and bought them back an hour later at 2.10?  Hahaha, yes.  Still, I've done my calculations on what earnings are going to look like for NAT and I still think it's trading nowhere near a reasonable P/E multiple.",
			"I'll be honest, I need to do more research on TNK, TK, and STNG, so I don't know enough.  I do know that NAT stands the most to gain short-to-medium term based on their business model.  They were severely undervalued because of past poor performance (though Q4 2019 was much, much better), and I think they may be trading at a more fair value now, but nowhere near their potential.",
			"Do you know what you're saying? \"Purest play in time charters and spot charters?\" All tankers are a \"time charters and spot charters\" play. NAT isn't any more spot exposed than most. Their mix is about even with peers. NAT doesn't stand to gain the most. Raw earnings power vs price they are totally inferior to every other name. They are l iterally the worst play. EURN will earn 4-5x more than NAT and right now is only trading for 60% more...",
			"I'm not going to get uncivil like you just did, but NAT has the lowest percentage of ships on long-term contracts (i.e. not spot or time charters) of the major tanker companies.  Do you know what their ratio and EURNs's ratio are?",
			"I'm looking at EPS here, not raw earnings, since I want to make $$.  I own EURN calls, too.",
			"Yes, EURN is 85% spot exposed, DHT is 60% spot exposed, FRO is ~90% spot exposed...",
			"And yes, I'm talking about EPS...if EURN makes $1 in a quarter NAT makes 20c in the same quarter...",
			"NAT is 95.6% spot exposed.  Would need to do a little more research into exact EPS numbers.",
			"Worth noting that vessel operating costs are higher for EURN.",
			"NAT misrepresents their vessel operating cost...they don't include financing charges and depreciation while all the others do. A 10% difference in spot exposure isn't going to make up for their total inadequacies in every other department. You will not find a single serious shipping investor or analyst who thinks NAT is a buy here. Most don't think NAT is a buy at $3.75...",
			"I would SHORT NAT and go LONG EURN and STNG",
			"NAT's run up compared to other companies puts it in meme stock territory and even if the fundamentals say it should have a major correction I'd be very hesitant to short it in this market. Going long on other companies that haven't benefited from the same publicity as NAT seems like a safer play to me.",
			"Shorting NAT is a good hedge to being long other tankers. This is a gift.",
			"Ah I see what you're saying. Appreciate your insight",
			"EURN has never gone above $15 in their last 5 years and is currently at around $12. Looks like like NAT also had a high of $15 a few years ago but with a higher upside currently. Could the next earnings smash past both these ATHs in your opinion?",
			"Cramer and Bloomberg are literally banned from saying anything nice about non-US stocks. Call it patriotism if you like I guess.",
			"The second someone in italy drops a euro on the floor and all they talk about is eurozone debt crisis smh",
			"NAT isn‚Äôt American and Cramer sucked the CEOs Divk",
			"I am retarded",
			"Agree but contango won't last forever.  The fact that retail is now playing the tanker trade is scary.  Look what happened to tankers the day oil rallied a few weeks ago.",
			"No Generic Memes, No Preschool Memes",
			"9.",
			"Sectors are cyclical and this sector has not had a bull run in ten years.  So yes nothing lasts forever but you are on the wrong fence...anyone is delusional if they think global oil demand is bouncing back...I have not heard any solutions to the fact in mid May there is zero storage left...but lets say that crisis is curtailed fact is no one is building ships as they do not know want to speculate on future tech/fuel regulations plus Asia shipyard are dormant...the supply of ships is getting smaller from attrition so until orderbooks are filled tankers could run for the next year",
			"There was a bull run in 2014-15.  TNK tripled in value.  TNK has tripled since last August.

			"I'm long calls and common and short puts. I bought May $12.5 calls today and have been long common since around $9. Will go longer via short puts that get assigned.",
			"Damn I was hoping their earnings would be after STNG",
			"You short?  Stng will kill it and all boats rise",
			"Nope I have $12.5c 6/19, but trading during earnings kills volatility, so I was hoping STNG would report first and send EURN up before their earnings",
			"I agree that NAT isn't necessarily the best in term of earnings but the public doesn't know EURN. Wouldn't you want the hype ticker?",
			"No you wouldn't want the hype ticker because that's the one that will head straight back to fair value when the momentum crowd forgets about it in hours / days / weeks. EURN is trading for less than it's worth.",
			"Why wouldn't NAT go to ATH like all tankers back in 2015/2016? They're still killing it right now.",
			"I‚Äôm also wondering this. Bought back in to NAT today after selling this morning. I don‚Äôt see any reason why it should stay so low, but if this was already priced in then it‚Äôs possible NAT became overvalued 2 - 3 weeks ago.",
			"SHARE COUNTS",
			"Thoughts on TNP?",
			"I took profits on TNP yesterday but it's a much better option than NAT. I still own the preferred shares and am short the puts.",
			"Yeah I feel the same. It's a good long imo",
			"Thanks Caliv.  What do you think NAT is worth in this pro-tanker environment?",
			"$6 best case if very generous with forward NAV...$4 likely case",
			"Thoughts on TNP and TNK?",
			"TNP and TNK are both great levered plays. TNK is better managed (consistently beat the spot market, friends in ops tell me TNK best to work with). TNP is buying back shares. TNP will do a bit better in a bad market (more conservative).",
			"TNK could pay off all of its debt this year due to spot positioning and market strength",
			"What do you think EURN is actually worth? It‚Äôs currently around $11.90",
			"Good luck finding volume on this üôÑ",
			"How about TK?",
			"I told a friend a few months ago (he asked me how to get a 10x on $5k) to buy TK $5 October calls. TK was trading at $2 then. I think now you've still got some upside but less. Maybe $7.5?",
			"Thanks for the response. I'm currently holding 5c 5/15 that I picked up for 0.90. Down quite a bit at the moment but hoping for a pop in the next few weeks",
			"thanks for making me feel better about the EURN calls I just bought",
			"I bought ridiculously long shot EURN 5/15 17.50c contracts for 20 bucks each the other day as a YOLO",
			"Little bit too far out of the money IMO",
			"Yeah but they were cheap enough, I figure if they move up a bit after earnings I can sell them to some schmuck for a 20% gain.",
			"And if not oh well",
			"Tell me what you think about $MMP? I've been following them since the dip and they seem really well positioned to take advantage of this whole thing. Owning such a large chunk of oil transport from the gulf to the rest of landlocked USA. They might not have as much storage as some and might lose revenue on refineries but I think they're a great contender in this current situation. As more and more companies build storage for oil they look for cheap land to build on and MMP is who ships oil to cheaper land areas.",
			"Honestly don't know enough about pipeline infrastructure and economics to give informed answer",
			"Understandable. Thanks for not just talking out your ass lol",
			"When does $EURN report Q1 earnings? And what is the consensus estimate",
			"Next week, consensus is around 4x the NAT estimate...and with special dividend shareholders should get around $1 back in dividends...",
			"So you are saying that the special dividend could be up to 8% of current share price?",
			"I think forward yield on May dividend could be as high as 60% annualized (15%), and definitely at least 30%. Not sure how much they'll declare but will be at least 80% of Q4+Q1 earnings...",
			"u/calvinfroedge what dates are you looking at for these?",
			"Related, I've seen some comments that oil could go negative again in June -- do you see that as a possibility?",
			"Oil could go negative again several months in a row. Check MacroVoices podcast with Jim Bianco and Erik Townsend",
			"Tanks very much for the info!",
			"Yeah you guys are right about that üëçüèΩ, nav is key for long term, nat will most likely be a pump and dump just because of how much exposure that tickers had and how many blind investors just jumped in. My question is though why hasn‚Äôt EURN gain any momentum recently and when will it start gaining a lot of momentum ?",
			"how do I best capitlize on these dividends now?",
			"Buy and hold EURN...May dividend (1 month from now) will be for 2 quarters",
			"Buy and hold until when?",
			"Until 3 months after contango in the oil market ends",
			"Thanks but I can never tell when I'm being trolled on this forum, haha.",
			"I genuinely meant that lol. When contango ends and oil use goes back to normal it will take time for storage to be depleted. Think it through and it makes sense. When stay at home measures end, we won't be able to instantly use all of the oil in storage.",
			"contango\nThanks - I bought a bunch of shares because of this post. Hoping it works out.",
			"What's your shot-in-the-dark guess on Q1 dividends?",
			"EURN Q1 dividend $1-1.25\nNAT Q1 dividend 14c",
			"Do you have an idea on their dividend date?  I sold some 5/15 12.5 puts and don't want to get hosed by the dividend risk.",
			"I'm estimating a peak of $11 for NAT. Since 2015 they've acquired 8 new ships but issued almost twice as many shares.",
			"Is fundamental still valid in this market? Valuation and stock prices do not align. Nothing makes sense anymore.",
			"What do you think about TGP.PB ?",
			"These preferred shares yield like 12% if bought right now.",
			"Think this company stays solvent until maturity in like 7 years?",
			"TGP has like 10 year charter coverage they definitely stay solvent, barring total collapse of civilization. 99% chance you can forget about those shares.",
			"That balance sheet looks like dogshit. Good luck because you are braver then me.",
			"Which balance sheet?",
			"Fuck it, I‚Äôll buy those too",
			"Just bought 5/15 $12.5c. I hope you‚Äôre not selling these lol. Everything makes sense but I‚Äôve seen this one pumped a lot so my Spidey Senses are alerted but I‚Äôm also Autistic so I‚Äôm ignoring them and rolling the dice.",
			"I bought those calls as well",
			"How long are you looking to hold? Through 5/7 earnings? Looking to hold any calls through an ex-dividend run-up?",
			"Do you think we will see the major gains after Q1 earnings (early May) 5/15 calls or Q2",
			"Depends on Q2 guidance, if guidance is anywhere near spot rates there will be a lot of upside",
			"Thoughts on FRO and TNP?",

If it is, they‚Äôve positioned themselves well to take advantage of the recovery. Betting it all on a quick recovery is obviously the best play, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they even see it as a likely outcome.",

			"One day last September an unidentified trader pumped more than $3 billion into a tech fund run by State Street Corp. Two days later that trader pulled out a similar amount.",
			"Why would someone make such a large bet‚Äîfive times bigger than any previous transaction in the fund‚Äîand then reverse it so quickly? It turns out that transfusions like these are tax dodges, carried out by the world‚Äôs largest asset managers with help from investment banks. The beneficiaries are the long-term investors in exchange-traded funds. Such trades, nicknamed ‚Äúheartbeats,‚Äù are rampant across the¬†$4 trillion U.S. ETF market, with more than 500 made in the past year. One ETF manager calls them the industry‚Äôs ‚Äúdirty little secret.‚Äù",
			"Typically, when you sell a stock for more than you paid, you owe tax on the gain. But thanks to a quirk in a¬†Nixon-era tax law, funds can avoid that tax if they use the stock to pay off a withdrawing fund investor. Heartbeats come into play when there isn‚Äôt an exiting investor handy. A fund manager asks a friendly bank to create extra withdrawals by rapidly pumping assets in and out.",
			"‚ÄúIf the IRS were looking at it, they would say that‚Äôs a sham transaction,‚Äù says Peter Kraus, a former chief executive officer of mutual fund manager AllianceBernstein Holding LP who now runs Aperture Investors LLC.",
			"Imagine that a grocer got a tax deduction every time someone returned a box of cornflakes to his store. Heartbeats are when the grocer asks a friend to buy all the boxes and return them, just to pocket more deductions.",
			"Fund managers and bankers say the trades are perfectly legal, and that most of the taxes that they help regular ETF investors avoid will be paid in later years. The biggest ETF managers, including BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard Group, all use heartbeats, with help from banks such as Bank of America, Credit Suisse Group, and Goldman Sachs Group, according to market participants who spoke on condition of anonymity. Spokesmen for those companies either declined to comment on the trades or defended their use. The Internal Revenue Service says it‚Äôs aware of heartbeats and wouldn‚Äôt say whether it considers them an abuse.",
			"To people in the industry, heartbeats are just smart tax strategy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs removing a negative from the investment process,‚Äù says Bruce Bond, a pioneering ETF executive who was among the first regular users of heartbeat trades. ‚ÄúThere really isn‚Äôt a need to have to pay the tax every year. The goal is the best investor experience you can have.‚Äù",
			"To understand heartbeats, it helps to know that they‚Äôre just a supersize version of something ETFs do every day. ETFs are funds whose shares trade all day on stock exchanges. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs aren‚Äôt sold directly to regular investors. Instead, they use banks and brokerage firms as middlemen. These large traders don‚Äôt transact in cash. They make an ETF bigger or smaller by adding portfolio stocks to it, or by taking them out. They call this activity ‚Äúcreating‚Äù and ‚Äúredeeming‚Äù ETF shares. (All this is invisible to small investors, who just buy ETFs from brokers.)",
			"Enter the Nixon-era tax law. In 1969,¬†Congress decreed¬†that mutual funds can hand over appreciated stocks to withdrawing investors without triggering a tax bill. Lawmakers never explained why they blessed the industry with this unique break, but back then, it didn‚Äôt seem like much of a giveaway. Mutual funds rarely took advantage of it, because their investors preferred cash payouts.\nFast forward to 1993, when American Stock Exchange executives¬†devising the first U.S. exchange-traded fund¬†realized they could put that old tax rule to a new use. Say an ETF needs to get rid of a stock that went up. Selling it would trigger a taxable gain that would ultimately be paid by fund investors. But handing the stock off to a broker who‚Äôs making a withdrawal achieves the same goal, tax-free. Every time a broker redeems a stake in a fund, it‚Äôs another chance to avoid taxes. That loophole gives ETFs a tax advantage over mutual funds. It went from a footnote in the tax code to the cornerstone of a new industry.\nFor some of the earliest ETFs, which followed broad indexes such as the S\u0026P 500 and rarely changed holdings, the daily process of brokers creating and redeeming was enough to wash away almost all capital gains. The first and largest ETF, State Street‚Äôs SPDR S\u0026P 500 ETF, hasn‚Äôt reported a taxable gain in 22 years. In contrast, a traditional mutual fund run by Fidelity Investments that tracks the same index had a taxable gain in 10 of those years.",
			"ETFs proliferated, and some new entrants shuffled their holdings more frequently, so routine redemptions weren‚Äôt always enough to wipe out the taxes. The PowerShares funds, co-founded by Bond, started trading in 2003 and changed their portfolios every three months. He says his funds wouldn‚Äôt have kept capital-gains taxes away without heartbeats. ‚ÄúThis tool was there,‚Äù says Bond, who sold PowerShares to Invesco Ltd. and now runs Innovator Capital Management LLC in Wheaton, Ill. ‚ÄúWe were the ones to first really utilize it to its full potential.‚Äù\nU.S. stock ETFs avoided tax on more than $211 billion in gains last year, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek tally based on annual reports of more than 400 funds. The disclosures don‚Äôt show how much of that is from the funds‚Äô routine use of the ETF loophole and how much is from special heartbeat trades that maximize the benefit. But heartbeats certainly contribute billions to the total.\nFunds pass taxable gains along to their investors, so by avoiding those gains, they‚Äôre allowing investors to defer the tax until they sell the ETF itself. The $211 billion in avoided fund gains probably translates to about $23 billion in deferred taxes last year. It‚Äôs the equivalent of a $23 billion, no-interest loan from the U.S. Treasury to ETF investors, with most of the benefit going to the¬†wealthiest Americans.\nHeartbeats have had a few nicknames over the years, including ‚Äúfriendlies,‚Äù but they haven‚Äôt attracted much attention outside the industry. Elisabeth Kashner, an ETF specialist at FactSet Research Systems Inc., was the first to write about the practice in a¬†December 2017 report. She called them heartbeats because the telltale blips in fund-flow data on her computer screen reminded her of a cardiac monitor. Bloomberg Businessweek identified 2,261 such blips in equity ETFs since 2000. Last year there were 548, worth a record $98 billion.",
			"Most heartbeats take place when an ETF has to get rid of stock because of a change in the index it tracks. That was the case in September with State Street‚Äôs $23 billion¬†Technology Select Sector SPDR. Some of the fund‚Äôs largest holdings, including Facebook Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc.,¬†were being dropped¬†from the portfolio because they were leaving the index the fund is designed to mimic. Both stocks had more than doubled since the fund first acquired them, so it probably faced a hefty tax bill if it sold them.\nOn Wednesday, Sept. 19, two days before the index change, $3.3 billion of new assets poured in, increasing the fund‚Äôs size by 14 percent. The additions came in the form of stock that matched the fund‚Äôs holdings at the time. The investor‚Äôs identity wasn‚Äôt disclosed, but market participants say that, given the size of the transaction, it was probably a large investment bank.\nOn Friday of that week, someone pulled more than $3 billion back out. Trading data suggest it was the same investor that had appeared two days before. Rather than take back the same shares of stock it had contributed 48 hours earlier, the investor appears to have walked away with the fund‚Äôs oldest shares of Facebook and Alphabet, the ones with the biggest capital gains. Thanks to winnings on stocks like that, the fund reported more than $4 billion in capital gains for the year. But since it used the ETF tax loophole to shield those gains from taxes, its annual report shows, it ended up reporting a $309 million capital loss to the IRS.",

			"It's an interesting loophole, although you're still hit with the taxes when you sell the stock so it's more of a tax deferment. Until you have actual money in hand I don't see how that benefits anyone unless you're wanting to avoid taxes by buying stocks, wait until a drop then ask for payout in stock to claim a capital loss.",
			"You could defer it indefinitely, and each sale of these stocks should be taxed every time an ETF takes profit.",

			"I‚Äôm going all in on these bets ahead of next week‚Äôs earnings. Before Covid-19, retail was 16% e-commerce. Now, it‚Äôs 80% and it will hold above 50% for some time. I recommend you get ahead of the digital economy trends here and make a big bet like I have. Over 4600 calls already placed. What y‚Äôall think?",
			"SHOP $900 and a couple $800 5/8\nETSY $90 5/8\nFVRR $45 5/15\nUPWK $7.5 5/15",

But timing was mostly luck.",
			"I no longer like Lululemon. Best quality joggers but I think they need more affordable offerings for the people.",
			"Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not qualified to give investment advice. I‚Äôm just asking for some!",
			"So you‚Äôre saying that SHOP, which is teetering around 20% higher than its previous ATH... is now going to shoot up another 30%+... roughly 55% higher than its previously ATH... all in the next 8 trading days?",
			"Hey it's only a 3333.33 forward P/E! That's a steal in this \"new bull market!\"",

			"These won‚Äôt push it to ATH because there are a ton of stocks dragging out indexes down",
			"Those stock prices don't happen without a general market upswing like we've seen over the past few weeks. Shop isn't going to a 100X price/sales ratio without a full on bull market behind it.",

			"You gotta understand that the gig economy is dying - due to lack of business. Upwork lives off freelancers' platform commission.",

I‚Äôm down 15k , been doing a lot of ‚Äòresearch‚Äô and I‚Äôve sat on my hands for a few weeks now, this could be huge if it goes my way",
			"what do you say to the argument that as small businesses struggle shop will see a decrease in revenue?",
			"That‚Äôs a good question. I think the ones that are prepared for digital will blossom and probably on Shopify or its competition. The other businesses will die if they are not essential. If the owners are smart, they start back up again without the brick and mortar burden. A lot cheaper.",
			"therein lies the problem, Shopify model is volume, servicing a ton of small to medium businesses. As e-commerce devours the marketplace most will struggle to transition to digital and when they do it will be too late. I see this giving amazon a near-monopoly. I would short shopify honestly as more and more smaller-medium sized businesses fail to hold onto their customer bases that are used to different experience entirely",
			"Shopify‚Äôs traffic has doubled in past 3 months compared to previous period according to executives tweeting too much.",

Sure, tons of businesses will create accounts but will Becky shop online at that cute store she liked to go inside of the \"ambiance.\" It's not as if those same businesses weren't utilizing Shopify at their retail location. Now, they're transitioning and I don't think it will work. Who knows I may be wrong",

			"I said what‚Äôs easiest way. I don‚Äôt use Reddit much. I‚Äôm just trying to solicit feedback.",
			"4600 calls are really easy to get on Robinhood.",

It‚Äôs got a lot of OI already and it‚Äôs got a lot better theta with 2/3rds the delta of the $7.5c still...  that‚Äôs what I would buy if I bought those.",

			"Shopify looking for that 100 price-sales ratio.",

			"Everyone's trying to play earnings for Q1 and we've seen some great wins and losses so far. The problem is that people tend to buy calls on a stock that has a positive earnings report already priced in and end up losing. An example of a stock that had their ER already is Dominos. Their price was going up slowly already up until a major sell off after their very positive earnings report. An example of a stock that's currently going through this is Twitter, as it's price has ramped up 15% in the last week already in anticipation and will most likely fall after earnings in two days (get puts btw).",
			"The key is to find the 'golden egg' of earnings, a stock with earnings that are far enough out and not priced in yet. A company that has actually benefited from the covid19 lockdown in unexpected ways. Ideally, you want to buy calls on a stock that people in general do not think will go up, so that any beat earnings would not be priced in. And you'll want to get into this stock over a week before the report. Take snapchat for example. Nobody expected it to go up after earnings, this is reflected in it's price a week before the earnings report, falling 10% between April 14th and April 21st. And then when earnings came, boom, 30% up and call holders profited. All of WSB was stunned.",
			"So I made the call on Snap on the daily discussion thread before it mooned and now I'm here with my next call. Because the earnings graphic for May 4-8 isn't out yet, I made my own rough one on MS paint and scrolled through all of them to see what would be a good buy. And I think I found my golden egg. Match or MTCH is an online dating company with web sites serving over 50 countries. A lot of people think they're just match.com but they also own OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, Tinder, and Hinge. They pretty much have the monopoly on dating apps. With the covid19 lockdown happening in the states and around the world, people are on their devices trying to socially connect while maintaining physical distancing. This is why snapchat soared last week. We can look at statements from Chief Executive Officer Shar Dubey that mentioned clear \"increases in engagement\" among their platforms reporting an increase in the number of conversations that people are having, along with the length of these conversations, which are up anywhere from 10-30% since the outbreaks started in many countries.",
			"Note how I'm making this post a full week before MTCH's earnings on the 5th? I've noticed time and time again that it's always better to do an earnings play earlier rather than later because the price generally runs up beforehand. We're trying to buy in before the run up. MTCH is now trading at $78-79 down over 4% from yesterday's high of $82.60. This dip makes it the perfect time to buy as I don't think you'll get a better price before earnings next week. The pre-covid peak was $92, and remember, covid19 is helping the dating platforms, so I do expect a best case scenario of it getting back up to this value. That would mean a 15% increase. I'm not into the meme lines, but here's some TA for those who crave it. These indicate a strong buy signal for literally all of last week.",
			"If that wasn't enough, Match has also changed it's platforms in the wake of the lockdown to make it more desirable. Just like how facebook introduced videochat, their website introduced 1:1 video chat. Match is also making dating advice more available to its users and launched a special ‚ÄúDating while Distancing‚Äù service that includes free access to dating experts. I'll be making another DD post on a completely different earnings play later this week. It's not as simple as printing out the sheet and throwing a dart at it. If you do your research, we'll all make tendies. :)",
			"tldr; MTCH 80c 5/15",
			"An increase in the value of the stock from 78 to 90 TODAY, if you bought that option today, would return 135%, where are you pulling 1000% from lol",
			"Okay, maybe not 1000% as premiums are high (on both the calls and the puts) but I strongly believe it'll go over $90.",

			"Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 4/25-4/27. I‚Äôm your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem \"important\" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.",
			"‚Äã",
			"I have seen a lot of predictions of where the market is headed in the future. Most of them have been complete shit written by idiots that don‚Äôt even know that you can exercise an option. There have also been a few that have got me thinking. What is the most reasonable thing that will happen in the coming months? Now I‚Äôm not writing all of this myself. I am combining the thoughts of many people and my own so do not take this as the gospel.",
			"‚Äã",
			"The Markets Future; The most likely thing to happen is that whenever we, as a nation, reopen there will be a large rise and then a second drop once everyone realizes the destruction that shutting the economy down has caused. The reopening of everything will act as a shot of adrenaline. People will come out of their homes in droves to go to the places they loved before the pandemic. These people will be on their way to businesses that are no longer open. Half of small businesses only have enough money on hand to last 27 days in the event of no cash flow. This is in the event of them being open and paying employees so we can stretch it out a little bit but they still have to pay utilities and rent. According to these figures, most small businesses can only last, at most, around two months. As we approach the third month of shutdown we can be sure that a good portion of America's small businesses will not survive.",
			"‚Äã",
			"Our small businesses make up 45% of US GDP. If even 25% of small businesses close that would translate to a loss of 2.3 trillion dollars. When people realize that the businesses they relied on are all closed, mass exodus of the stock market will ensue. People do not want to invest when they fear not being able to make their next rent payment, or God forbid their cell phone gets shut off. Humans are emotional creatures. Fear will override any sentiment pushed by the government. They can say that they are bailing out companies, forgiving debt nationwide, and giving out free blowjobs but nothing will stop a recession with small businesses shutting down nationwide.",
			"‚Äã",
			"So here is what I believe will happen. The market will continue to go up. We may not hit the highs we saw before the drop but we will get up there. It will rise because people see that the virus is slowing, we are beating it. Then we will open, and within a month we will drop and that will be the beginning of a recession. Again, do not take this as gospel. This is just what seems most likely. Calls still work and will work until a date is confirmed that we will open. Puts will work on individual companies but not market wide like they did in early March.",
			"‚Äã",
			"This is not the type of write up I usually do but good DD was scarce this weekend. The remaining DD I have will be short but a worthwhile read.",
			"‚Äã",
			"WING; Wingstop is one of the few plays for this post that looks decent. Their revenue has been rising however their net profit has been declining exponentially because of growing interest on their loans which went up from 5M to 17M in two years. They only have around 74M in assets which is more than 5 times less than what they are liable for. Their only growth strategy is to open more stores, the CEO dropped 36,000 shares, and no shares have been bought by executives in the last 12 months. These figures should be enough to tell you that Wingstop will go down. The next question is when and I can not tell you that for certain. If you want to buy in now, buy long puts for next quarter (June/July). I, myself, am going to wait a couple months and watch it develop so save this post so that you'll remember. Read this post for more information.",
			"‚Äã",
			"HTHT; Huazhu is a hotel company based in China. Puts on hotels are not really a monumental discovery but something about this has caught my eye. This is a play that I am skeptical of myself but read this post and come to your own conclusions. I do intend to buy a few $25p 5/15 just because they are cheap and the volume is immense. It mirrors what happened with LK in a scary way. 17,000 put options at $25p 5/15 were bought on April 22 for this ticker. The post that got me interested goes into much more detail about why they are likely to sink from their price now ($30.56) to below $25 so if this peaks your interest too then I recommend reading it and deciding for yourself.",
			"‚Äã",
			"SNAP; There is a much better write up right here for more information but I will summarize it here. Snapchat is not making much on ads and the advertising industry gets fucked during an economic downturn. Their expenditures scale with the amount of users active and because of the shutdown use is up, while the ads are going to go down. The bull in me says, ‚ÄúIts Snapchat, it'll be fine‚Äù, but the bear in me says, ‚ÄúCompanies which derive most of their revenue from ads will do well in a downturn.‚Äù Take what you wish. I am staying out of this one as it's hard to call which way it will go.",
			"‚Äã",
			"Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!",
			"‚Äã",
			"TLDR; Economy open= Market down, Wingstop is a shitshow, Huazhu is sketchy, and Snapchat is a gamble. Read previous posts for more plays that are still viable and can make you money since this one was a little sparse.",
			"Plays; Watch for a confirmed open date and then buy puts, WING puts for June/July, HTHT puts at $25 for 5/15, SNAP puts maybe for late May/June.",

			"Thanks for your regular posts! Followed your options to the letter YOLO let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôm a millionaire by the time quarantine ends",
			"Quality DD, thanks for the post!\nI am too retarded to make any of those plays though, lol.",
			"WING has to be the most manipulated stock around. Somehow in a time of crisis and no sporting events, they are posting ATHs because they have delivery. Incredible. When was the last time you saw a restaurant chain with a PE of ~164?  Pretty soon it will probably pass AMD and their retard PE of 188.",

			"Good point. There is so much more to look into. /u/zredzitz mentioned that some of these companies are diversified into dry goods. I've noticed that due to decreased shipping demand, some of those ships are carrying oil. Scrubbers and environmental restrictions are likely to be less of a concern given the current economic situation.",

			"Okay during a stroke of absolute genius last week, I thought I would do DD on some household name but niche stocks, and came across Tootsie Roll (TR). Their earnings call was coming up and I did some digging through the 10k and news reports. This company has been flat for ages, they have manufacturing based out of the midwest/north east states (pretty fucked due to covid), Spain (fucked), and Ontario (Province taking a fairly hardline stance on being closed so also pretty fucked).",
			"Then I thought, who the fuck in their right mind is still eating Tootsie rolls? So I did some analysis on their big brands, I have NEVER heard of half of their candies and the only ones worth mentioning are Junior Mints (which are pretty dope). Turns out they sell a good portion of their Junior Mint candies through movie theaters (fucked), and the vast majority of their yearly sales comes from Halloween (probably the holiday that is the most antonymous with social distancing).",
			"Their cash/balance sheet seems fine so they will likely weather the storm BUT, you have a flat/declining company with productions that are mostly fucked due to Covid and their biggest sales event of the year likely going to take a big hit.... so HOW THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT TRADING ABOVE WHAT IT WAS IN JAN???? This motherfucker rallied all through the dip in Feb/Mar.",

What you find below is a graph of the $SPY since 2017, when the career of one, Lil Yachty, took off (post his first break out album, 'lil boat'). All data gathered from Wikipedia, because this shit aint my job - fuck you.",
			"‚Äã",
			"red = album; green = single",
			"Cherry-picking my data, and with the exception of 'teenage emotions' (06-26-2017), we see that Lil Yachty prefers his albums to come out during any deviating drop in the stock market. An interesting tidbit - of these three albums, 'lil boat 2' (03-09-2018) and 'nuthin' 2 prove' (10-19-2018) received a sub-45% Album of the Year score. With this information, I believe a lower AOTY score is correlated with lower stock market performance.",
			"The only single to drop when this trend began is 'who want the smoke' (07-06-2018), which happened during a girth-happy boom period, right before the late-2018 market dip. This significant trend suggests each following single would signal a future dip. His most recent single, 'oprah's bank account' (03-09-2020), is situated at the very beginning of this economic atrocity.",
			"With an album on the horizon, and lil yachty's preference for gracing the world at its most bearish, I believe the worst is yet to come, but when it does come, it'll be some heavy bukkake type shit.",
			"‚Äã",
			"red = album; blue = album reveal",
			"Given that we have yet to witness the fallout of yachty's newest album, 'lil boat 3' (TBA), and given how long its been since both his most recent single drop and album reveal, Yachty has been deviating from his creative norm. We can speculate this album drought reflects something greater than Yachty himself. Maybe he believes the world isn't yet bearish enough. Maybe this being without his music is his attempt at teasing us into a deeper recession. Regardless, blue balls are being felt the world over.",
			"Lastly, and most importantly, is this shitty graph.",
			"‚Äã",
			"red = album; cyan = movie cameo",
			"Obviously yachty is rock star. That said, his most creative moment was between mid-2018 and early 2019. This also overlapped a quick dip and recovery. I don't consider myself some doomsayer, but I do subscribe to r/wsb so that's probably a lie I tell myself to sleep at night. If I were to leave you with any message, let it be this - Whether yachty is the catalyst for an eventual economic downturn or not, the economy needs to nut; without some severe dark reflection of it's life we may spiral into a damp art-lacking recession, the depths of which we may never fully climb out of.",

			"Monday's rally put Tesla's market capitalization at $145 billion. Importantly for Musk, its stock market value reached a six-month average of $96 billion. Hitting a six-month average of $100 billion would trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of his two-year-old pay package.",
			"Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. Taking Monday's Tesla closing stock price of $798.75 as an example, Musk could sell those shares for a profit of $758 million.\nADVERTISEMENT\nContinue reading the main story",
			"Graphic - Elon Musk's options payout: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpweexwpw/Musk%20payout.gif\nMusk receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla's market cap and milestones for revenue and profit growth. Musk has already hit a growth target necessary for the first options to vest.\nThanks for reading The Times.\nSubscribe to The Times\nA full payoff for Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives.",
			"When Tesla unveiled Musk‚Äôs package in 2018, it said he could theoretically reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since issued shares to compensate employees, and last year it sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible.",
			"The potential payout for Musk comes after Tesla said this month it would furlough all non-essential workers and implement salary cuts during a shutdown of its U.S. production facilities because of the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic has slashed U.S. demand for cars and forced several other automakers to also furlough U.S. workers.\nTesla's quarterly report after the bell on Wednesday will show the damage done to global demand by the pandemic and the extent to which a recovery from the coronavirus in China, and a return to production at its Shanghai plant, are helping the U.S. carmaker.",
			"Investors will also focus on Tesla's cash burn related to its interrupted manufacturing and sales, and on Musk's expectations for consumer demand in a potential long-term global recession, Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a client note last week. The closure of the Fremont plant came just as Tesla was increasing production of its new Model Y sport utility vehicle.",
			"Analysts on average expect March quarter revenue to jump 30% to $5.9 billion, according to Refinitiv. That consensus revenue estimate is down from $6.7 billion at the start of February. Analysts on average expect a non-GAAP loss of 36 cents per share.",
			"When shareholders approved Musk's pay package, Tesla was valued at about $53 billion and it faced a cash crunch, production delays and increasing competition from rivals. The pay deal was viewed as massively ambitious because it implied the company's value could grow as much as ten-fold in 10 years, and its potentially huge size led some shareholders to oppose it.\nTesla's market capitalization since then has expanded to nearly three times the combined values of General Motors and Ford Motor.\nMusk's subsequent options tranches would vest at $50 billion increments of Tesla market capitalization over the agreement's 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla's market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the high tech vehicle maker achieves several revenue and profit targets.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich, editing by Peter Henderson and Tom Brown)",

			"tnp 6/19, 9/18 5 and 7.5",
			"asc 7/17 12.5",
			"eurn 6/19 20",
			"TL;DR people think everyone knows about tankers.... people with money didn‚Äôt do tanker math yet... I did math. Buy tankers.",
			"For you all that think it‚Äôs too late to get in the tankers, some of these companies are going to put up earnings numbers in Q2 that are 1/4-1/2 of their market cap.",
			"EURN will put up about 3.50eps- stock is 12.20",
			"TNK 7.50eps -25",
			"TNP 2.00 -4 (that‚Äôs 50%)",
			"NAT 1- stock price anywhere from 4-20, at this point who knows",
			"DHT- 2.50 -8.30 (going to have a disappointing q1 because they got unlucky in the beginning of q1, as they said in their q4 conference call)",
			"FRO 2.50- stock 10.50",
			"And half the quarter is basically locked in because the ships are chartering for the first week of May at high rates. The day rates would have to crash to alter these projections. Even if rates went to 0 TNP still makes 1/4 of its market cap q2.",
			"The product tanker guys, like stng and asc are even higher going forward, because their rates just jumped this past week. Just today, an LR2 (2 sizes smaller than a VLCC) now charters for more a day than a VLCC. Now this wasn‚Äôt all quarter, but if it kept up, those rates would earn stng and asc (who own only MRs) closer to 80%-90% of their stock price every 90 days.",
			"Lastly, every conference call these companies do, they let the analyst know what their average fleet TCE (day rate) is for the quarter to date. If you look at the analyst projections right now, they have not been updated yet. You are going to a get line of upgrades as the q1 conference calls end because of the monster numbers that the tankers have already put up in q2.",
			"To show you how out of date the projections are, EURN has a q2 projection of 1.20.... they earned that in April.",

			"For those who just bought NAT at the morning high, just have some diamond hands. Look at 4/23 to 4/25, for instance. It dipped then mooned. NAT is STILL over its yesterday high. If you have big bull balls, you'll just buy more at the dip.",
			"It‚Äôs tanking because that‚Äôs what tankers do.",
			"And 4/21.",
			"Don‚Äôt doubt your vibe, homies. NAT to $15 5/12",
			"I can't even buy nat $15 lol strikes only to 10 for me",
			"I sold my calls in the morning at $8.40üëäüèºüòºüëäüèºlooking to get back in",

			"Holding on to a nat call myself",
			"So, keep holding my DHT 10/16 calls?",
			"Yes.",
			"Just bought FRO and then it went down 6%, oh well. Still up over all on my tanker stocks. This pullback is worrying me though. Put way too much of my money into this shit.",
			"patience my son, wait till earnings",
			"Why is EURN not going up/NAT is the only real moonshot rn?",
			"Because WSB and YouTube all think NAT is the best company.",
			"They are making loooootttsss offff monneeeey",
			"Buy buy buy!!!!",
			"so get EURN and not nat, huh",
			"They really aren‚Äôt even comparable anymore. One is going to rise based on fundamentals, and the other is going up based on fomo and WSB. They both just happen to carry oil. For me nat is worth about 5 and eurn about 20. Doesn‚Äôt mean they will go that way.",
			"Well, hopefully over time smart money will level things out. And since you actually did the math, you're smart money to me. How about TNP? Is that one the proportionally best? Wouldn't it grow the most?",
			"It‚Äôs my largest position. If it were at the same valuation as nat it would be 12 a share.",
			"Gotcha. Going in tomorrow then, thanks.",
			"How do we view Oil in this? Price of oil seems to effect these tanker stocks, if oil is going to start going up due to hopefulness of economies opening, then I think we need to bail on tankers.",
			"Not short term. Tankers have contracts locked in for half year/ year; and demand won‚Äôt outstrip the surplus for some time after that.",
			"NAT $15 5/12",
			"Sounds good to me üëåüèª I‚Äôm in",
			"NAT to $11",
			"NAT to $15 5/12",
			"Jesus dude. The only reason I would believe that is because a few of the clean tankers have earnings 5/8 which might get the hype going on top of the negative contracts. But still, $15 ?",
			"So what do you think fro and nat could hit by 5/15 and 6/19?",
			"Full believer in all of this. People thinking oil to $13 = storage solved are victims of the craziest recency bias. Oil was $19 the day it closed at -$37, and the storage problem has blossomed from an Oklahoma problem to a global problem.",
			"I'm convinced these will print. In NAT, FRO, EURN , and OSG; adding TNK, TNP, probably ASC. Hoping the spread limits any earnings disappointment issues if one company \"missed the boat.\"",
			"Also check out DSSI.",
			"Even if tanker companies weren‚Äôt being used to store oil offshore I would still say buy calls prior to earnings.  The ships biggest operating expense is fuel and fuel for the vessels are at all time lows. There going to be saving a lot of money.",
			"What happened to DHT, why unlucky?",
			"timing with their ships getting in and out of China. Missed a big spike at the beginning of q1",
			"Why no FRO?",
			"what you mean?",
			"What‚Äôs your thought on FRO. They seem to dump every day?",
			"weak hands. nothing with the business side.",
			"I put like 20% into fro what I put into nat, not because they're worse but because it would give me migraines watching these swings",
			"Okay so what timeframe should i be selling my ITM TNP calls 5$ call 9/18 expiration",

			"Fro and stng dragged me straight to hell, I think people were bailing to put it all into hot girl NATalie. Though the resulting NAT move kept me positive, lol. Not worried, but disappointed.",

The years that had the highest next day movements were the years that had the largest revenue beat. I believe the revenue in this upcoming earnings report will surprise everyone. Amazon, in the past month, has hired an additional 175,000 employees to keep up with the demand. In 2019, Amazon had 798,000 employees. Amazon increased their employee count by 21.9% in one month. There is a direct correlation between revenue and number of employees.

And they sell their products online. For some reason yahoo finance (lol) isn't showing it's annual interest expense (or maybe I'm just way to sleepy). Negative ebitda does seem alarming but I'm guessing the market is pricing in that it keeps growing. Altho, and I'm talking shit at this point, I don't see their products moving more in this landscape, but I might be (and probably are) wrong in assuming this.

They will soon become the dominant chipmaker in laptops due to their superior power efficiency, which is much more important than the desktop processor market that they have recently been making large strides in. Long AMD bless Lisa Su",
			"Too bad no one can afford consumer goods rn",
			"What do you mean? The economy is stronger than ever!",
			"I took profits on AMD today because it always falls after earnings, so this time it will probably moon.",
			"This is easily a triple-digit stock in a few years if you guys have patience. It could match Intel's market cap (4x from here) or so if they keep growing at this rate.",

			"nah i usually only go 10% on earnings, i'm not that retarded",
			"If AMD is still down on open tomorrow I will humbly apologize -\ncongratulations you weren't retarded",
			"guh",
			"Sorry i think you meant 100%",
			"I read somewhere yesterday that all the unusual options activity in Marvell may be connected to AMD earnings. Anyone know if there is any truth to this and why?",
			"Marvell are a significant tsmc customer which makes chips for several companies. Tsmc increased eps by 94% last week. Amd are exclusively buying from tsmc's 7nm production. It is likely that wafer reservation volume and pricing imply something about AMD and Marvell performance.",

			"This is a tough one to predict. I have $57 calls 5/1 but may switch to puts. I think the only way it continues to climb is if They beat expectations AND provide strong guidance. If they don't meet both then I think it'll drop quite significantly. And if they do meet both conditions.. then will they blow past $60 despite already being up 30% for the year so far? This is a huge bet that can either elevate AMD to the echelon of Amazon, Tesla (near untouchable) or it will correct to a more reasonable price. Either way good luck to everyone",
			"Xbox and ps5 will probably be requesting more chips so I expect solid guidance",
			"What kinda retarded DD is this? Sony is literally scaling back Q1 shipments for the PS5 and we're about to head into a recession. Console also chips have razor thin margins which is why NVDA doesn't really care about this market. Not to mention this is the definition of PRICED IN.. Q1 is gonna be straight, but watch Sue pull guidance... the next 3 quarters are gonna be bleek as enterprise(which is where most of the $ are made) puts the brakes on purchasing hardware.",
			"If AMD is still down on open tomorrow I will humbly apologize - Except you were wrong about enterprise epyc",

You will.\nYou ever see someone stuck in their house play XBOX all day?\nYou ever see how much silicon has been reserved to make 160million chips for these consoles? TSMC beat EPS by 94%.",

			"They might grow as big as Tesla or Amazon in the future but not right now I'm betting they will drop after ER",

			"Agree with this!",
			"TSMC makes their CPUs (Taiwan...as in Taiwan #1) and Ryzen 3rd Gen has absolutely killed it in the consumer market and their EPYC processor has been picked up by multiple brands.  Along with AMD powering both next-gen consoles due out holiday season.  They will beat earnings!  Currently holding stock and calls.",

Navi is 5nm and it still doesn't compete above the rtx2070.\nUntil AMD has a flagship chip beating the xx80ti nvidia chips you're losing money on that trade",

			"BURLINGTON, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LabCorp (NYSE:LH), a leading global life sciences company that is deeply integrated in guiding patient care, announced that beginning today, it will offer antibody tests for the virus that causes COVID-19. There will be no upfront out-of-pocket costs to people who receive an order for a test through a doctor or healthcare provider, including telemedicine providers.",
			"Antibody blood tests offered by LabCorp are administered across the U.S. at tens of thousands of doctors‚Äô offices and at LabCorp‚Äôs nearly 2,000 patient service centers, including LabCorp at Walgreens locations. Results will be available to the ordering healthcare provider within 1-3 days after the date of specimen pick up. They are also available to patients in the LabCorp Patient‚Ñ¢ mobile app.",
			"Adam Schechter, president and CEO of LabCorp, said: ‚ÄúWe are bringing the full force of LabCorp‚Äôs science and testing capabilities to serve individuals across the U.S. whether they had the virus or believe they have the virus. We stand with all Americans, healthcare workers, and those on the frontlines who are helping people in need.‚Äù",
			"Richard Ashworth, president of Walgreens, said: ‚ÄúCOVID-19 response requires collaboration across industries and sectors, and we‚Äôre pleased to further our relationship with LabCorp in order to improve access to COVID-19 and antibody testing in many of the communities we serve. By continuing to expand our testing efforts and resources, together we‚Äôll play a critical role in helping to keep our communities healthy and enabling more Americans to return to work once they can do so safely.‚Äù",
			"LabCorp began antibody blood testing on a limited basis to high-priority healthcare workers in late-March and currently has capacity to perform over 50,000 antibody tests per day. By mid-May, LabCorp expects to be able to perform 200,000 tests per day as more tests and testing platforms receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).",
			"The COVID-19 antibody blood tests detect the presence of antibodies to the virus and can help identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus. While antibody tests are helpful to understand if an individual has developed antibodies and a potential immune response, antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude infection. Knowing a patient‚Äôs results might be useful in the determination of important decisions, such as the ability for hospital staff to care for patients.",

But if they get picked up to store oil off shore (which I have done before) then they will profit immensely. Fuel has been one of the biggest expenses for shipping companies. With fuel prices this low there saving a lot of money and when a ship is a floating storage tank they don‚Äôt burn fuel.  You catch my drift?   NAT is def a good play before earnings.",

They don‚Äôt hold the front month future, the only reason it went to 0 was because of ‚Äútechnical issue‚Äù of people not being able to take physical delivery as long as they hold contracts 2-3 months out such as July, Aug, and Sep (which they do) they aren‚Äôt exposed to the same selling frenzy and contango is much lower as you get out to the later months, they will keep rolling them over to the later contracts and it won‚Äôt go to 0.

They have more market cap then any other company and less costs per load. It‚Äôll go up towards earnings these dudes rock the dividend payments.",

			"Oil storage is surging because of supercontango.  Demand for oil dropped due to impacts of C19 stay-home orders. Since some of the OPEC participants insisted on keeping their production line running, we literally have nowhere to store the oil. Meanwhile, oil prices are dropping.  This extra oil has to go somewhere, so oil traders are turning to floating storage. This has diminishing returns. They still need to sell that oil for a profit. Paying high storage premiums erodes their profits, so there is going to be a ceiling on floating storage prices - and they‚Äôre going to want to empty floating storage as quick as possible. Buyers of oil can get a cheaper price from those who aren‚Äôt paying floating storage fees.",
			"When the world has no place to store oil, the production line stops. When the production line stops, floating storage is the first to drain (because of its high carry cost). When the floating storage drains, they sit empty for a while because everyone has a shit load of oil - so there is no need to move it.  Oil traders are going to lose their asses when the pay floating storage. They‚Äôre not going to keep doing it.",
			"FRO got hit pretty hard since the US fracking boom.  They‚Äôre so desperate for investors that their TTM dividend payout ratio is nearly 200%.  For ever dollar of profit that FRO makes, they are paying their investors two dollars in dividends. This slowly drives their stock price into the ground because their equity continuously erodes.",

			"That's a funny way to spell FORD",
			"You are correct that they will moon. Won‚Äôt be for another month tho",

			"Boeing is one of the most strategically important companies in the US. Of course, their business model is also completely destroyed right now, and they'd probably be completely fked without multiple bailouts.",

			"go back and read my comment history.  I have several posts that go into detail about why the Max 8 is a dead airframe.",
			"Is there a point where it becomes unprofitable for the airlines and boeing?",
			"That point has already been reached.  The longer aircraft stay grounded, either because they are dangerous and in need of remediation/re-engineering/recertification or because they are stuck on the ground due to economic conditions, the more uneconomical they become to operate later.  This entire evolution, between the Max 8 and the global pandemic, will cause the cost of flying to become much more expensive in the future.",
			"How long can the current planes remain parked?",
			"This is probably one area where Boeing is ahead of the curve.  They had all the Max 8s parked before the Kung Flu hit the world.  I'm sure the exercise is costing Boeing quite a bit of money, but because Boeing was first to the watering holes, I'm the sure the airlines had to pay more for parking non Max 8 aircraft because of the Max 8.",
			"Hangar rash is a thing and keeping aircraft outdoors is even rougher on aircraft (see Mike Busch's seminar on the subject).",
			"For aircraft that carry passengers many parts are calendar limited.  As time passes, maintenance costs accrue and the value of the aircraft declines.  Those parts are typically very limited, but very expensive.",
			"aircraft have been sitting on the ground for two years and some seemingly insignificant failure point makes it really dangerous to fly passengers",
			"Yes.  If you look though Mike Busch's maintenance philosophy (he specializes in general aviation, but takes his lessons from fleet military and commercial aviation), you'll see exactly this idea documented as reality.  Basically, aircraft the fly regularly are far more reliable than even aircraft that have experienced recent maintenance.  This fact helped the Allies win WWII.",

Iran is the only one worth even considering worrying about, and that would be a limited air campaign at worst. Raytheon and Northrop are your go to‚Äôs for ordinance and tactical systems. Them and General Dynamics.",
			"TLDR: long BOMBS",
			"I was bearish asf last week.. but I think airlines will PUMP! Bought calls for BA and AAL, couple shares too",
			"No.",
			"Deal - Didn't even read the article. The deal was key for BA to compete in the regional market and was a response to the Airbus/Bombardier (really just Airbus) A220.  BA will no longer be involved in producing a regional jet to compete in a very hot market in aviation.",
			"Earnings - None. Negative. They're paying money. They have a bunch of useless 737s piling up that who knows if and when they can start selling.",
			"Bailout - Maybe,, but who cares. They are the MAX at this point, and it's the reason behind the stocks insane run up until the crashes.  If BA cannot sell the max, if they have trouble finding buyers, they're big time screwed.  What other major revenue generators does BA have? Nothing remotely close to the MAX. 737NG and 777X. The 777X is a fine aircraft... so far, but it's not what airlines want.  They want the MAX and the neo.  Med haul, efficient, 150-180ish passengers.  Military below.",
			"Boomers - Yea, some retirees jumping in on a company with dwindling prospects doesn't get me hyped for a BA resurgence.",
			"Military - BA makes about 2/3 of rev from commercial, rest from military.  And guess what, they're insanely bad management fucked their future military marketability as well. They lost both the 22 and the 35 airframe contract to LMT. They won the KN tanker contract, but it's such a shitshow the USAF straight up refused delivery of these because they were so fuckily made. They make JDAMs and they sell parts for existing military aircraft in addition to R\u0026D to retrofit and modernize older planes.",
			"Boeing NEEDS to sell the MAX to survive. I'm sure that will happen but they are selling a plane that's had nothing but terrible press into the worst aviation market imaginable. They have a newish CEO, and maybe he can turn things around for BA. If he can't, what makes sense is BA will split their commercial and military divisions, declare bankruptcy on the commercial side, restructure, and figure it out from there.",
			"OP straight planning to make money on murder. I hope you never complain about any kind of problem irl, that would be quite ridiculous.",
			"Do you mean because I expect price to go up because I think US is gonna be bombing someone withing a year?"

			"With most of the market way overbought (IMO), and not interested in dumping money into companies like Amazon and Google - which are great companies, but P/E's of 89 and 39?  I just cant. So was looking for industries that are oversold, but with long-term growth potential.",
			"Oil fits the bill.  It's economic crack for at least the next 10-20 years, there's a limited supply (though there's clearly plenty at the moment), and a number of profitable, high-growth potential companies with more rational P/E's.",
			"My theory,  based on a good deal of research, is that oil supply will not keep up with demand in the next 1-3 years, primarily from rapid depletion rates in US shale, continued demand growth from China and India, and significant disinvestment in exploration since 2015.  In short, a supply crunch and higher prices are inevitable.",
			"So I've been looking for undervalued companies that are profitable at low oil prices, have solid management, manageable debt, and proven reserves, as these will become very profitable when oil prices rise.",
			"I've been playing the volatility in Denbury Resources (DNR), a small cap domestic producer who does Enhanced Oil Recovery for the past couple years and managed to turn $5k into $20k by playing swings as the stock's gone anywhere from $1.00 up to $6.50 and now back down to $2.70.  If you don't like high beta, not a stock for you!",
			"While some of my moves have been lucky in terms of timing, even if I get caught holding at a relatively high price, I'm confident within a couple years oil will be back in the $70-100 range and the stock will rebound.",
			"I've decided with this latest dip to play a bit more seriously.  So I went in big (for me at least) dropping $100k on DNR, Marathon (MPC) and Callon (CPE).",
			"DNR just announced they're purchasing Penn Virginia, have been building a record of profitability, paying off debts, and executing on their drilling plans and have a P/E of 4.2.",
			"Marathon is a more stable company, recently purchased Andeaver to become the largest refiner in the US.  They're consistently profitable and are poised to benefit when the International Maritime Organization starts enforcing new emissions standards and ships will have to move from using high-sulfur bunker c oil to diesel - which will be a boon for diesel refiners.  UBS estimates the green shipping market could be worth at least $250 billion over the next five years.  Additionally, they pay around a 3% dividend. At a P/E of 7.9, they seem like another solid opportunity.",
			"Callon Petroleum has 87,000  acres of best in class Permian footprint and have grown EBITDA margins at a compounded annual growth rate of 45% over past 4 years.  They're killing it on production and recently acquired a large number of adjacent acres to their high-performing wells, have been growing earnings since 2013 and are trading at a P/E of 14, which is a little high, but I think their growth potential is worth it.",
			"All three companies are trading near their 52 week lows with the recent crash in oil prices, which is why I decided to come in now.",
			"A number of short term issues have kept oil stocks down - the general sense that the US fracking industry is all debt-driven and not profitable - which is true for many companies, but not the ones above.  A transportation squeeze with some pipelines at capacity, which is about to change with the opening of new pipelines.  A glut of oil as Saudi tried to drive US frackers out of business, which had been changing with OPEC+ limiting production to drive prices up until this recent cluster fuck with Iran sanctions not being enforced thanks to Trumpster's ruse to to keep prices low leading up to the midterms, but I think he played his ace and OPEC will be announcing cuts at their next meeting.",
			"Could oil drop back into the $30's and $40's...maybe.  I doubt it.  If it does, I'll be doubling down.  Because it's going to be back up in the $70's-100's.",
			"Anyway, I'm far from a pro at this, but interested to hear your thoughts on Oil as a sector, if anyone else thinks it's an opportunity, thoughts on these companies and predictions for how much money I'll lose.  Oh, and catchy titles for when I go over to WSB and post up my \"Lost it all\" portfolio screen grab.",

So, as the price of cheese falls, the dairy cattle are sent to the slaughter as the current supply for cheese far exceeds demand and more money can be made on selling beef than the cheese the cows produce. Once the demand for cheese stabilizes as people are getting out and about, the price of cheese will skyrocket to $2.50 - $3.00 / lb as the supply of dairy cows cannot be quickly increased to meet the new demand.",
			"From the USDA's most recent report on cheese (here):",
			"Report 17 - Released on April 24, 2020",
			"Cheese production varies from plant to plant, region to region. Milk availability does not.      Cheese plant managers are managing output against the widely accessible milk supplies. Some      are cutting back, working on projects and updating. Others are running six and seven day      workweeks. Spot milk prices ranged from $6 to $8 under Class for the second week in a row.      Some cheese producers have reported upticks week over week in food service demand, but when      compared to previous years, the differences are noteworthy. Retail orders are somewhat busy,      as cheese market prices are so low customers are less hesitant to take on a little extra.      Regarding storage, multiple contacts report cold storage is and has been a concern. As      inventories grow, some cheese producers are looking to age/store cheese loads and wait for      greener market pastures. All said, cheese market tones are bearish. Market contacts hope to      see some corrections posthaste, as some states are looking to, or already have, begun to lift social distancing restrictions.",
			"Information for the period April 20 - 24, 2020, issued weekly",
			"Secondary Sourced Information:",
			"The weekly average price for CME barrels is $1.0255, compared to $1.0115 one week ago. CME  blocks‚Äô weekly average is $1.0310, compared to $1.0080 last week.",
			"And from the previous report (here):",
			"Cheese inventories are growing for the most part. There are some positive reports from cheese producers who are primarily shipping into retail channels, but many cheese producers are growing concerned about storage space. Some food service demand is reportedly growing      slightly week to week, although when in comparison to previous years, sales are noticeably      slower. Other contacts have said that even weekly changes are on a downward slant.      Production, in those plants that are running regularly, is active. There are some plants  closed for longer-than-normal holiday breaks, while others are closed to use this time for plant updating/maintenance. Milk is very available and wholly discounted on the spot market.      Reported spot milk prices in the Midwest was $8 to $6 under Class III. Cheese markets are      some of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
			"We are starting to see an upward trend in the price of cheese (here). For a 40 lb block, the price increased by $0.12 / lb for a 40 lb block and $0.0425 / lb for a barrel of cheese. We may be heading for a spike in cheese prices soon.",
			"When Should You Go Short?",
			"Papa John's uses approximately 2.5 million pounds of cheese a week. Today, that means their cheese expenditures are approximately $2.6 million / week for cheese compared to $5.0 million / week when the cheese hits $2 / lb. The business model of Papa John's is no longer sustainable once the price of cheese hists approximately $2 / lb. Consequently, when you see cheese hit $2 / lb it is time to short Papa John's (PZZA) and likely Domino's (DPZ) pizza.",
			"Keep track of the price of cheese here.",

So the increase in cheese increases a new $19.5M increase in operating expenses every quarter it is at $2 / lb.

Intel withdrew its previous financial forecasts for the full year, citing uncertainties tied to the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated financial downturn. Intel also cautioned that tailwinds boosting sales of PCs and servers in the first quarter were likely to fade in the second half of the year, due in part to a likely slowing of corporate spending.",

Get into these UVXY calls with me.‚Äù And I did and you can see where it helped me make a good recovery. My dad threw in $50K and turned it into $300K.",

Right now with the earnings calls going either way though I am sitting out options wise. Probably make a re-entry next week.",

I have been blessed with enough good luck that I make around $130K and wife makes $50K. So we should be good on a house that isn‚Äôt too expensive with this much of a down payment. No debt either :D",

The past few weeks have been just swinging around what I feel SPY will be at for the next week or two. For example today I just sold 30K in SPY 283C I bought last week when SPY was at 280 for a 15% gain. I don‚Äôt trust the market enough to hold long term or hold any crazy OTM plays.",

			"I think the reason the market has performed like it has over the last month is because of the unprecedented influx of dumb money. There are no sports to gamble on but people still want to gamble, especially when they have nothing to do in a lockdown. So, what do they do? They go and download robinhood and start placing bets. I saw an article that said deposits were up like 300% for robinhood. Its the same for similar apps. Then you have the FOMO group of millennials that are also bored. They think investing is as easy as picking stocks of big names that they recognize. Seemingly zero consideration, or even awareness, of valuation. These people have so far been rewarded and now they all think theyre gordan gecko. Its self fulfilling- they keep buying these stocks and pushing the price up, and that reassures them then to buy more, and then more FOMO dumb money jumps in too, and it keeps rising. These stocks might as well be piggy banks because thats all thats happening. The prices are just a function of dumb money crowding into the market. When does it end? When institutional investors sell and the dumb money panics? When sports come back? When they run out of money to push into the market? I know it wont have anything to do with fundamentals or reality.",

			"Please don‚Äôt post your ridiculous shower thoughts and pretend you‚Äôre onto some radical new thinking",
			"I dont think I presented this as any sort of radical new thinking. I also think youre pretty naive to overlook this crowd, especially with such low volume trading. And id like to know where you got that 10% figure as well.",
			"No it‚Äôs regular people. That‚Äôs why volume is low. Everyone I know has been buying stocks for the past month and they‚Äôve all been waiting 10 years for this crash. Everyone on wsb is just retarded saying it‚Äôs all fake, and not talking to average people. Stocks go up because people are buying not because of the current situation. They won‚Äôt go down until until people are selling and it would take a huge ton of new bad unexpected events in order for these people that buy dips to sell.",

They drew down their LOC. They pumped tens of millions of shares onto the market. And, the Saudis jumped in. This is why the stock will not get to low single digits, ever. Worst case scenario - Arison (like Adelson) gives some of his own money to save the company. That's only if the stock price drops to around $5. But $0 or close to that? Not happening.

			"Molly\nMDMA Golf?  Wasn't interested in golf until now, tell me more.",
			"It was an accidental discovery on a bachelor party. Molly + golf courses is one of the most incredible experiences ever. It‚Äôs so beautiful. Bonus points if you have a buddy with a big driver, it‚Äôs like watching a missile of love slice through a live painting.",

			"I agree with you that stated are going to reopen, that they will try to make everything go back to normal. But considering all the news regarding how infectious it is (not coming from the media, but coming straight out the mouth of healthcare) professionals, it‚Äôs my belief that we will see a second spike when we reopen.",
			"It‚Äôs my belief, given the available information, that the earlier the states reopen, the more severe the second spike will be. Sure, maybe YOU don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that dangerous, but if the majority of doctors agree that this is a global pandemic, then I think it‚Äôs something to take seriously.",

			"I bought cruises and JETS. Which is an etf with all airlines",
			"United Airline stocks (I know stocks aren't welcome here)? They were 4x the price before the rona faggotry",

			"Do you know which cruise lines have what reputation? Carnival the party cruise line that draws a younger audience, RCL is boomers, and Norwegian is booshie and really old fucks.",
			"Yeah Carnival's main cruise line has that reputation but they have a diversified portfolio of cruise options to consider, which could hold them down a little if boomers are not going on cruises.",
			"Boomers prefer Royal and Norwegian. Carnival is basically a bet that young people will go racing back to cruise lines. Pent up spring break demand. I'm sure all of them will go up if any of them go up.",
			"I'm gambling on all three, but more heavily on Carnival.",
			"There are 328 million people in the US. Say this virus only has a .05% fatality rate like the NY sample provides some evidence for. Means that if everyone got it, you would have 16.4 million deaths. That‚Äôs unlikely as we would build herd immunity when 60%-80% of the population gets infected. So at the lowest estimate of 60% infected to herd immunity, with a fatality rate of .05%, you‚Äôre looking at 9.4 million dead.",
			"So okay fine let‚Äôs isolate the at risk population. They‚Äôre the ones that pump up the fatality rate. But first, what is the at risk population? Studies show that people over 60 years old are more likely to die  Obviously the older they are, or additional issues like heart disease or obesity, the higher the death rate. In any case if you‚Äôre going to shelter-in-place the at risk population, being 60 years or older, you‚Äôre looking to lockdown 68 million Americans. That‚Äôs a lot. And what about the people who are younger than 60 but have heart disease, are obese, respiratory diseases, etc. Are we gonna just have them stay inside too?",
			"Finally, and this gets missed all the time... this virus, when severe - requires intensive medical intervention. We‚Äôre able to keep the deaths as low as they are because we‚Äôre putting people on ventilators and medical staff are constantly attending to them. That was one of the major goals of lockdowns - to prevent hospital systems from becoming overwhelmed. Because once they‚Äôre overwhelmed, the death rate soars. Exactly one month ago we had 2,754 Covid deaths recorded, as of right now we have 56k deaths - and this is with mass lockdowns across the US.",
			"This right here.",
			"The best case scenarios like ‚Äúreopen with .5% IFR‚Äù (said by people who can‚Äôt do basic math) still looks like an economic apocalypse to me.",
			"0.05% fatality rate and 60% infected would be less than 100,000 deaths. You forgot to divide by 100 for your percent sign.",
			"0.5% fatality rate would put deaths in line with the 1 million deaths worst case predictions that haven't happened.",
			"If the studies claiming 25% of people in NYC were infected are actually true and not bullshit, that is going to kill the fear of this thing and the economy will take off like a rocket back to (wild guess) 80% of where it was a year ago.",

The fact that this development resulted in minimal price movement reflects uncertainty that Abbott can deliver on the scale of its rivals. In this climate of urgency, their \"shoot first ask questions later\" approach to COVID antibody testing will be the winning one.",
			"Abbott has never been considered the industry leader in diagnostic testing. Quarterly diagnostic revenue was only up 0.7% in Q1, the weakest organic performance of their 4 branches. Abbott's ARCHITECT, the flagship of their diagnostic fleet, is a relatively high throughput serology platform that already has a place in many hospitals and state laboratories. They are currently charging over $100 for each COVID antibody test, which is an order of magnitude higher than their other antibody tests. The price point is also uniform, meaning they will charge public labs full price. I suspect that state governments will happily turn over grant money to subsidize testing as their constituents continue to demand seroprevalence surveys and back-to-work initiatives. Better yet, there won't be any public outcry over price-gouging because the IgG test is not used to diagnose active infections in sick patients.",
			"I expect the antibody test hype train to be running at full steam in about a month's time. By then, the positive Q2 results will probably be priced in. Therefore, I will be going in on June monthlies rather than waiting until August for an earnings play.",
			"As a bonus, there will probably be a jump in RHHBY when they announce their antibody test in early May as they throw caution to the wind and join ABT at the table (no options chain tho, RIP)",
			"TLDR: Abbott is Best in Wild West Contest for Antibody Test. ABT $100c 6/19",
			"lots of writing, used capitals, spaced out paragraphs,",
			"I'm in for 10 contracts. thanks B",
			"username checks out",
			"I agree. Calls on Abbot.",
			"This seems too cogent and responsible for this sub. ABT $150c 5/1",
			"Here's the thing. Antibody tests in general have really shitty specificity and sensitivity by medical test standards. Even if Abbot meets criteria of 95% for both (which would be impressive by antibody test standards) , that means that 5% of actual cases will be missed and 5% of healthy people will receive false positives.",
			"If you are regularly testing high risk employees then this is unworkable as this results in a 0.95^n chance of your worker being sent to isolate where n is the number of tests done. If you tested twice a week every worker has a roughly 19% chance of getting sent to isolation each month regardless of whether they have the virus or not.",
			"Thus, short of a major breakthrough in specificity, antibody testing will end up being considered unworkable and Abbot will go the way of Gillead.",
			"That said, it'll take time for the normans to realize this so riding the pump may not be a bad idea.",
			"I hate to be a mouthpiece for Abbott because there's a good chance they're talking out of their ass, but the self-reported sensitivity and specificity of their new ELISA test are 100% and 99.5% respectively. Some other ELISA tests validated on the same platform (HAV, HCV, Syphilis) have comparable rates (98%+). HBV, which requires multiple antibody tests to determine immune status has an abysmal specificity at 90% but still 100% sensitivity.",
			"In terms of applicability, short of 100% specificity/sensitivity I don't really see the test being useful for seroprevalence when it's clearly at such a low rate nationwide. What concerns me about a workplace application is not the sensitivity but rather the specificity. Remember that we are diagnosing immune status rather than infection status. What happens when an employee without the antibodies tests positive and walks around freely thinking they're protected?",
			"Taking a step back, this entire thing could be built on a house of cards, because we don't know how long the antibody confers immunity or if it protects people from every \"strain\". In the next month, however, I see $$$ for Abbott. The big money will start rolling in much later with the post-vaccine immune status panels.",
			"I liked your bojack princess Caroline tldr style. I'm up 22% on the stock though so I'm going to sell that after earnings. The FDA has been approving trash antibody tests for the last month and if there's anything certain in pharma you can't get away with selling trash for very long.",
			"You may be referring to rapid antibody tests, which are distinct from these blood draw antibody tests. The latter was approved via EUA on Sunday and is far more established in assessing immune status",
			"I think my point still stands and it's still a good play.\nCan I get some credit for spotting the princess Caroline tldr reference? Then you can have your upddoots",
			"Okay fair enough lol good job picking that out",

Amazon is not making the same ad revenue they had been making, they're selling home necessities.  You think brocolli is buying ad space?  What about toilet paper, buying ad space?  Did you want to buy and high end electronics and get them shipped to you during lockrown?  If you did Amazon wasn't shipping them, so advertisers were not listing.  I lost a lot of money doing emotional trading involving SPY, and from experience I suggest you exit at the beginning or end of market.",

			"‚Äã",
			"BTW the stock I've been murdering during this time is OKE",
			"Condors are part of the family Cathartidae which contains the New World vultures, whereas the 15 species of Old World vultures are in the family Accipitridae, that also includes hawks, eagles, and kites. The New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors. However, they both are carrion-eaters and have distinctive bare heads",
			"Both condors are very large broad-winged soaring birds, the Andean condor being 5 cm shorter (beak to tail) on average than the northern species, but larger in wingspan. California condors are the largest flying land birds in North America. The Andean condor is second only to the wandering albatross (up to 3.5 m) in terms of wingspan among all living flying birds.",
			"The adult plumage is uniformly black, with the exception of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck which are meticulously kept clean by the bird. As an adaptation for hygiene, the condor's head and neck have few feathers, which exposes the skin to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and solar ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The head is much flattened above. In the male it is crowned with a caruncle or comb, while the skin of the neck in the male lies in folds, forming a wattle. The skin of the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals.[citation needed]\nAndean condor soars over southern Peru's Colca Canyon\nImmature California condor",
			"The middle toe is greatly elongated, and the hinder one but slightly developed, while the talons of all the toes are comparatively straight and blunt. The feet are thus more adapted to walking as in their relatives the storks[citation needed], and of little use as weapons or organs of prehension as in birds of prey and Old World vultures. The female, contrary to the usual rule among birds of prey, is smaller than the male.",
			"Although the California condor is, from beak to tail, about five cm longer, the Andean condor has a wider wingspan, ranging from 274‚Äì310 cm (8.99‚Äì10.17 ft)[5] and heavier, reaching up to 11 to 15 kg (24 to 33 lb) for males and 7.5 to 11 kg (17 to 24 lb) for females.[6] Overall length can range from 117 to 135 cm (46 to 53 in)[7] Measurements are usually taken from specimens reared in captivity.",
			"California condors' wingspan measures up to 2.9 m (9.5 ft), and they can weigh up to 10.4 kg (23 lb). The skin on the necks will vary in color, depending on the age of the birds. Adult birds' skin color can range from cream, pink, yellow, or even orange during breeding season.",

			"I fucking love you",
			"YAY!!!!",
			"You are good.",

			"Do you understand what a credit spread is? For example, a call credit spread is when you sell a call at one strike while buying a call at a higher strike. If the stock expires below the lower strike, you make money.",
			"A put credit spread is the opposite: buy the lower, sell the higher, stock expiring above the higher strike makes you money.",
			"An iron condor is opening both a put credit spread and a call credit spread. If the stock expires between the higher put strike and the lower call strike, you make money. Ie, it is a bet that the stock will stay between those two ‚Äúinner‚Äù strikes.",
			"Use a tool like optionsprofitcalculator.com to visualize what the profit/loss diagram looks like.",
			"To the more experienced people reading this, yes you can create ICs out of other combinations of ‚Äúsub-spreads‚Äù but conceptually I find this breakdown most informative to the beginner.",

If Fortnite is a replacement for CoD, is there really a replacement for Starcraft? WOW subscription model? Mobile games using these IPs?

			"Hi guys I had a quick question, I am going to play goiigke earnings and am planning to buy calls beofre close (yes I know the IV crush but I‚Äôm pretty positive google is going to do well). I have about $2.5k that I want to buy calls with but here is my question. What strike and expiration should I get? Should I do one $1265 call 5/1 or two $1300 call 5/1? Which will be recommended if google does do well in earnings? Also would it be better to get further out expiration like 5/8 though I‚Äôll have to get a bigger strike? Thank you",
			"if you think they'll do well then go full yolo 5/1 and sell on open. Bear in mind though IV Crush is so hard that I've seen 5% gains on stock lose 50% value on (OTM) calls.",
			"Yes I agree, so one $1265 call will be a bit safer?",
			"I wouldn't touch any tech with a 10 foot pole right now due to IV, but if you're dead set on a google call, minimize your IV crush potential. The more ITM your strike and the further your expiry makes you take in less risk. Think what would happen if google missed earnings, and the market rationally choses to drop the stock. Would you be willing to lose your entire $2.5k and hold a worthless option? If you held more ITM instead you have less leverage, but still more than holding the stock, and you risk losing less if things so south (Or flat).",
			"I can't give you exact strike or expiry, it's literally just a slider for how much risk tolerance you have and I would have 0 in tech so wouldn't buy any of the options.",
			"Don't forget good news = stock down.",
			"Answer: the $1300 calls on 5/1 will do better if Google explodes upward.",
			"Opinion: Google is not going to explode upwards this sounds like a bad play. They recently cut investment into their cloud segment (their growth driver) to hold cash because they expect their ad segment (their cash cow) to suffer.",
			"you broke the one rule... done trade options based off earnings. you gonna lose all that sweet sweet premium.",
			"It's very likely that they'll meet expectations but the guidance will be shit and investors aren't going to like it.",
			"I'll throw you a bone here and tell you that the Page RPM for one of my sites with AdSense on is in March 10% lower than in Feb, and in April 33% lower than March.",
			"So, they might meet expectations but will fall on guidance. Stay safe.",
			"They‚Äôve just bounced off $1300 resistance again. I don‚Äôt see it going up. Ad spend is down.",
			"Go further out because IV will rape your profit unless google explodes after earnings",
			"The other way you can hedge against the IV is to create a spread, sell an option near to the strike price."
